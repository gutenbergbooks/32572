<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 83px;">
<img src="images/drop-t.png" width="83" height="100" alt="T" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'>HE present volume is the second of the
selected stories from Hans Andersen. Together
the books include what, out of a
larger number, are the best for children's use.
The story-telling activity of this inimitable genius
covered a period of more than forty years. Besides
these shorter juvenile tales, there are a few which
deserve to survive. "The Ice Maiden" is a standard,
if not a classic, and "The Sandhills of Jutland"
was pronounced by Ruskin the most perfect
story that he knew.</div>

<p>It adds a charm to the little stories of these two
volumes to know that the genial author traveled
widely for a man of his time and everywhere was
urged to tell the tales himself. This he did with
equal charm in the kitchens of the humble and in
the courts and palaces of nobles.</p>

<p>As was said in the preface to the first volume,
wherever there are children to read, the stories of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span>Hans Christian Andersen will be read and loved.</p>

<h2>HANS ANDERSEN'S FAIRY TALES</h2>



<h2>THE FLAX</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 83px;">
<img src="images/drop-t.png" width="83" height="100" alt="T" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'>HE flax was in full bloom; it had pretty
little blue flowers, as delicate as the wings
of a moth. The sun shone on it and the
showers watered it; and this was as good for the
flax as it is for little children to be washed and
then kissed by their mothers. They look much
prettier for it, and so did the flax.</div>

<p>"People say that I look exceedingly well," said
the flax, "and that I am so fine and long that I
shall make a beautiful piece of linen. How fortunate
I am! It makes me so happy to know that
something can be made of me. How the sunshine
cheers me, and how sweet and refreshing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
is the rain! My happiness overpowers me; no
one in the world can feel happier than I."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, no doubt," said the fern, "but you
do not know the world yet as well as I do, for
my sticks are knotty"; and then it sang quite
mournfully:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Snip, snap, snurre,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Basse lurre.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The song is ended."</span><br />
</div>

<p>"No, it is not ended," said the flax. "To-morrow
the sun will shine or the rain descend.
I feel that I am growing. I feel that I am in full
blossom. I am the happiest of all creatures, for I
may some day come to something."</p>

<p>Well, one day some people came, who took hold
of the flax and pulled it up by the roots, which
was very painful. Then it was laid in water, as if
it were to be drowned, and after that placed near
a fire, as if it were to be roasted. All this was
very shocking.</p>

<p>"We cannot expect to be happy always," said
the flax. "By experiencing evil as well as good
we become wise." And certainly there was plenty
of evil in store for the flax. It was steeped, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
roasted, and broken, and combed; indeed, it
scarcely knew what was done to it. At last it
was put on the spinning wheel. "Whir, whir,"
went the wheel, so quickly that the flax could
not collect its thoughts.</p>

<p>"Well, I have been very happy," it thought
in the midst of its pain, "and must be contented
with the past." And contented it remained, till
it was put on the loom and became a beautiful
piece of white linen. All the flax, even to the
last stalk, was used in making this one piece.</p>

<p>"Well, this is quite wonderful," said the flax.
"I could not have believed that I should be so
favored by fortune. The fern was not wrong when
it sang,</p>

<div class='poem'>
'Snip, snap, snurre,<br />
Basse lurre.'<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>But the song is not ended yet, I am sure; it is
only just beginning. How wonderful it is that,
after all I have suffered, I am made something
of at last! I am the luckiest person in the world&mdash;so
strong and fine. And how white and long
I am! This is far better than being a mere plant
and bearing flowers. Then I had no attention, nor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
any water unless it rained; now I am watched
and cared for. Every morning the maid turns me
over, and I have a shower bath from the watering-pot
every evening. Yes, and the clergyman's wife
noticed me and said I was the best piece of linen
in the whole parish. I cannot be happier than I
am now."</div>

<p>After some time the linen was taken into the
house, and there cut with the scissors and torn
into pieces and then pricked with needles. This
certainly was not pleasant, but at last it was
made into twelve garments of the kind that everybody
wears. "See now, then," said the flax, "I
have become something of importance. This was
my destiny; it is quite a blessing. Now I shall
be of some use in the world, as every one ought
to be; it is the only way to be happy. I am now
divided into twelve pieces, and yet the whole
dozen is all one and the same. It is most extraordinary
good fortune."</p>

<p>Years passed away, and at last the linen was
so worn it could scarcely hold together. "It must
end very soon," said the pieces to each other.
"We would gladly have held together a little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
longer, but it is useless to expect impossibilities."
And at length they fell into rags and tatters and
thought it was all over with them, for they were
torn to shreds and steeped in water and made
into a pulp and dried, and they knew not what
besides, till all at once they found themselves
beautiful white paper. "Well, now, this is a surprise&mdash;a
glorious surprise too," said the paper.
"Now I am finer than ever, and who can tell
what fine things I may have written upon me?
This is wonderful luck!" And so it was, for the
most beautiful stories and poetry were written
upon it, and only once was there a blot, which
was remarkable good fortune. Then people heard
the stories and poetry read, and it made them
wiser and better; for all that was written had a
good and sensible meaning, and a great blessing
was contained in it.</p>

<p>"I never imagined anything like this when I
was only a little blue flower growing in the
fields," said the paper. "How could I know that
I should ever be the means of bringing knowledge
and joy to men? I cannot understand it
myself, and yet it is really so. Heaven knows<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
that I have done nothing myself but what I was
obliged to do with my weak powers for my own
preservation; and yet I have been promoted
from one joy and honor to another. Each time I
think that the song is ended, and then something
higher and better begins for me. I suppose
now I shall be sent out to journey about
the world, so that people may read me. It cannot
be otherwise, for I have more splendid thoughts
written upon me than I had pretty flowers in
olden times. I am happier than ever."</p>

<p>But the paper did not go on its travels. It was
sent to the printer, and all the words written
upon it were set up in type to make a book,&mdash;or
rather many hundreds of books,&mdash;for many more
persons could derive pleasure and profit from a
printed book than from the written paper; and
if the paper had been sent about the world, it
would have been worn out before it had half
finished its journey.</p>

<p>"Yes, this is certainly the wisest plan," said
the written paper; "I really did not think of
this. I shall remain at home and be held in
honor like some old grandfather, as I really am<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
to all these new books. They will do some good.
I could not have wandered about as they can, yet
he who wrote all this has looked at me as every
word flowed from his pen upon my surface. I
am the most honored of all."</p>

<p>Then the paper was tied in a bundle with
other papers and thrown into a tub that stood
in the washhouse.</p>

<p>"After work, it is well to rest," said the paper,
"and a very good opportunity to collect one's
thoughts. Now I am able, for the first time, to
learn what is in me; and to know one's self is
true progress. What will be done with me now,
I wonder? No doubt I shall still go forward.
I have always progressed hitherto, I know
quite well."</p>

<p>Now it happened one day that all the paper
in the tub was taken out and laid on the hearth
to be burned. People said it could not be sold
at the shop, to wrap up butter and sugar, because
it had been written upon. The children in the
house stood round the hearth to watch the blaze,
for paper always flamed up so prettily, and afterwards,
among the ashes, there were so many red<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
sparks to be seen running one after the other,
here and there, as quick as the wind. They called
it seeing the children come out of school, and the
last spark, they said, was the schoolmaster. They
would often think the last spark had come, and
one would cry, "There goes the schoolmaster,"
but the next moment another spark would appear,
bright and beautiful. How they wanted to
know where all the sparks went to! Perhaps
they will find out some day.</p>

<p>The whole bundle of paper had been placed
on the fire and was soon burning. "Ugh!" cried
the paper as it burst into a bright flame; "ugh!"
It was certainly not very pleasant to be burned.
But when the whole was wrapped in flames, the
sparks mounted up into the air, higher than the
flax had ever been able to raise its little blue
flowers, and they glistened as the white linen
never could have glistened. All the written letters
became quite red in a moment, and all the
words and thoughts turned to fire.</p>

<p>"Now I am mounting straight up to the sun,"
said a voice in the flames; and it was as if a
thousand voices echoed the words as the flames<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
darted up through the chimney and went out at
the top. Then a number of tiny beings, as many
as the flowers on the flax had been, and invisible
to mortal eyes, floated above the children. They
were even lighter and more delicate than the
blue flowers from which they were born; and as
the flames died out and nothing remained of the
paper but black ashes, these little beings danced
upon it, and wherever they touched it, bright red
sparks appeared.</p>

<p>"The children are all out of school, and the
schoolmaster was the last of all," said the children.
It was good fun, and they sang over the dead
ashes:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Snip, snap, snurre,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Basse lurre.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The song is ended."</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>But the little invisible beings said, "The song
is never ended; the most beautiful is yet to come."</div>

<p>But the children could neither hear nor understand
this; nor should they, for children must
not know everything.</p>

<h2>THE DAISY</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 121px;">
<img src="images/drop-n.png" width="121" height="100" alt="N" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'>OW listen. Out in the country, close
by the roadside, stood a pleasant house;
you have seen one like it, no doubt, very
often. In front lay a little fenced-in garden, full of
blooming flowers. Near the hedge, in the soft green
grass, grew a little daisy. The sun shone as brightly
and warmly upon her as upon the large and beautiful
garden flowers, so the daisy grew from hour to
hour. Every morning she unfolded her little white
petals, like shining rays round the little golden sun
in the center of the flower. She never seemed to
think that she was unseen down in the grass or
that she was only a poor, insignificant flower. She
felt too happy to care for that. Merrily she turned
toward the warm sun, looked up to the blue sky,
and listened to the lark singing high in the air.</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>One day the little flower was as joyful as if
it had been a great holiday, although it was only
Monday. All the children were at school, and
while they sat on their benches learning their lessons,
she, on her little stem, learned also from
the warm sun and from everything around her
how good God is, and it made her happy to hear
the lark expressing in his song her own glad
feelings. The daisy admired the happy bird who
could warble so sweetly and fly so high, and she
was not at all sorrowful because she could not
do the same.</p>

<p>"I can see and hear," thought she; "the sun
shines upon me, and the wind kisses me; what
else do I need to make me happy?"</p>

<p>Within the garden grew a number of aristocratic
flowers; the less scent they had the more
they flaunted. The peonies considered it a grand
thing to be so large, and puffed themselves out
to be larger than the roses. The tulips knew
that they were marked with beautiful colors, and
held themselves bolt upright so that they might
be seen more plainly.</p>

<p>They did not notice the little daisy outside,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
but she looked at them and thought: "How rich
and beautiful they are! No wonder the pretty
bird flies down to visit them. How glad I am that
I grow so near them, that I may admire their
beauty!"</p>

<p>Just at this moment the lark flew down, crying
"Tweet," but he did not go to the tall peonies and
tulips; he hopped into the grass near the lowly
daisy. She trembled for joy and hardly knew
what to think. The little bird hopped round the
daisy, singing, "Oh, what sweet, soft grass, and
what a lovely little flower, with gold in its heart
and silver on its dress!" For the yellow center in
the daisy looked like gold, and the leaves around
were glittering white, like silver.</p>

<p>How happy the little daisy felt, no one can
describe. The bird kissed her with his beak, sang
to her, and then flew up again into the blue air
above. It was at least a quarter of an hour before
the daisy could recover herself. Half ashamed,
yet happy in herself, she glanced at the other
flowers; they must have seen the honor she had
received, and would understand her delight and
pleasure.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>But the tulips looked prouder than ever; indeed,
they were evidently quite vexed about it.
The peonies were disgusted, and could they have
spoken, the poor little daisy would no doubt have
received a good scolding. She could see they were
all out of temper, and it made her very sorry.</p>

<p>At this moment there came into the garden
a girl with a large, glittering knife in her hand.
She went straight to the tulips and cut off several
of them.</p>

<p>"O dear," sighed the daisy, "how shocking!
It is all over with them now." The girl carried
the tulips away, and the daisy felt very glad to
grow outside in the grass and to be only a poor
little flower. When the sun set, she folded up
her leaves and went to sleep. She dreamed the
whole night long of the warm sun and the pretty
little bird.</p>

<p>The next morning, when she joyfully stretched
out her white leaves once more to the warm air
and the light, she recognized the voice of the
bird, but his song sounded mournful and sad.</p>

<p>Alas! he had good reason to be sad: he had
been caught and made a prisoner in a cage that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
hung close by the open window. He sang of the
happy time when he could fly in the air, joyous
and free; of the young green corn in the fields,
from which he would spring higher and higher
to sing his glorious song&mdash;but now he was a
prisoner in a cage.</p>

<p>The little daisy wished very much to help
him. But what could she do? In her anxiety
she forgot all the beautiful things around her,
the warm sunshine, and her own pretty, shining,
white leaves. Alas! she could think of nothing
but the captive bird and her own inability to
help him.</p>

<p>Two boys came out of the garden; one of
them carried a sharp knife in his hand, like the
one with which the girl had cut the tulips. They
went straight to the little daisy, who could not
think what they were going to do.</p>

<p>"We can cut out a nice piece of turf for the
lark here," said one of the boys; and he began to
cut a square piece round the daisy, so that she
stood just in the center.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 339px;">
<img src="images/p017i.png" width="339" height="500" alt="So the daisy remained, and was put with the turf in the lark&#39;s cage." title="" />
</div>

<p>"Pull up the flower," said the other boy; and
the daisy trembled with fear, for to pluck her up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
would destroy her life and she wished so much
to live and to be taken to the captive lark in
his cage.</p>

<p>"No, let it stay where it is," said the boy, "it
looks so pretty." So the daisy remained, and was
put with the turf in the lark's cage. The poor
bird was complaining loudly about his lost freedom,
beating his wings against the iron bars of
his prison. The little daisy could make no sign
and utter no word to console him, as she would
gladly have done. The whole morning passed in
this manner.</p>

<p>"There is no water here," said the captive lark;
"they have all gone out and have forgotten to
give me a drop to drink. My throat is hot and
dry; I feel as if I had fire and ice within me, and
the air is so heavy. Alas! I must die. I must bid
farewell to the warm sunshine, the fresh green,
and all the beautiful things which God has created."
And then he thrust his beak into the cool
turf to refresh himself a little with the fresh grass,
and, as he did so, his eye fell upon the daisy.
The bird nodded to her and kissed her with his
beak and said: "You also will wither here, you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
poor little flower! They have given you to me,
with the little patch of green grass on which you
grow, in exchange for the whole world which was
mine out there. Each little blade of grass is to
me as a great tree, and each of your white leaves
a flower. Alas! you only show me how much I
have lost."</p>

<p>"Oh, if I could only comfort him!" thought
the daisy, but she could not move a leaf. The
perfume from her leaves was stronger than is
usual in these flowers, and the bird noticed it,
and though he was fainting with thirst, and in his
pain pulled up the green blades of grass, he did
not touch the flower.</p>

<p>The evening came, and yet no one had come to
bring the bird a drop of water. Then he stretched
out his pretty wings and shook convulsively; he
could only sing "Tweet, tweet," in a weak, mournful
tone. His little head bent down toward the
flower; the bird's heart was broken with want
and pining. Then the flower could not fold her
leaves as she had done the evening before when
she went to sleep, but, sick and sorrowful, drooped
toward the earth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>Not till morning did the boys come, and when
they found the bird dead, they wept many and
bitter tears. They dug a pretty grave for him
and adorned it with leaves of flowers. The bird's
lifeless body was placed in a smart red box and
was buried with great honor.</p>

<p>Poor bird! while he was alive and could sing,
they forgot him and allowed him to sit in his
cage and suffer want, but now that he was dead,
they mourned for him with many tears and
buried him in royal state.</p>

<p>But the turf with the daisy on it was thrown
out into the dusty road. No one thought of the
little flower that had felt more for the poor bird
than had any one else and that would have been
so glad to help and comfort him if she had
been able.</p>

<h2>THE PEA BLOSSOM</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 83px;">
<img src="images/drop-t.png" width="83" height="100" alt="T" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'>HERE were once five peas in one shell;
they were green, and the shell was green,
and so they believed that the whole world
must be green also, which was a very natural
conclusion.</div>

<p>The shell grew, and the peas grew; and as
they grew they arranged themselves all in a row.
The sun shone without and warmed the shell,
and the rain made it clear and transparent; it
looked mild and agreeable in broad daylight and
dark at night, just as it should. And the peas, as
they sat there, grew bigger and bigger, and more
thoughtful as they mused, for they felt there must
be something for them to do.</p>

<p>"Are we to sit here forever?" asked one.
"Shall we not become hard, waiting here so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
long? It seems to me there must be something
outside; I feel sure of it."</p>

<p>Weeks passed by; the peas became yellow,
and the shell became yellow.</p>

<p>"All the world is turning yellow, I suppose,"
said they&mdash;and perhaps they were right.</p>

<p>Suddenly they felt a pull at the shell. It was
torn off and held in human hands; then it was
slipped into the pocket of a jacket, together with
other full pods.</p>

<p>"Now we shall soon be let out," said one, and
that was just what they all wanted.</p>

<p>"I should like to know which of us will travel
farthest," said the smallest of the five; "and we
shall soon see."</p>

<p>"What is to happen will happen," said the
largest pea.</p>

<p>"Crack!" went the shell, and the five peas
rolled out into the bright sunshine. There they
lay in a child's hand. A little boy was holding
them tightly. He said they were fine peas for
his pea-shooter, and immediately he put one in
and shot it out.</p>

<p>"Now I am flying out into the wide world,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
said the pea. "Catch me if you can." And he
was gone in a moment.</p>

<p>"I intend to fly straight to the sun," said the
second. "That is a shell that will suit me exactly,
for it lets itself be seen." And away he went.</p>

<p>"We will go to sleep wherever we find ourselves,"
said the next two; "we shall still be rolling
onwards." And they did fall to the floor and
roll about, but they got into the pea-shooter for
all that. "We will go farthest of any," said they.</p>

<p>"What is to happen will happen," exclaimed
the last one, as he was shot out of the pea-shooter.
Up he flew against an old board under
a garret window and fell into a little crevice
which was almost filled with moss and soft earth.
The moss closed itself about him, and there he
lay&mdash;a captive indeed, but not unnoticed by God.</p>

<p>"What is to happen will happen," said he to
himself.</p>

<p>Within the little garret lived a poor woman,
who went out to clean stoves, chop wood into
small pieces, and do other hard work, for she was
both strong and industrious. Yet she remained
always poor, and at home in the garret lay her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
only daughter, not quite grown up and very delicate
and weak. For a whole year she had kept
her bed, and it seemed as if she could neither
die nor get well.</p>

<p>"She is going to her little sister," said the
woman. "I had only the two children, and it
was not an easy thing to support them; but the
good God provided for one of them by taking
her home to himself. The other was left to me,
but I suppose they are not to be separated, and
my sick girl will soon go to her sister in heaven."</p>

<p>All day long the sick girl lay quietly and patiently,
while her mother went out to earn money.</p>

<p>Spring came, and early one morning the sun
shone through the little window and threw his
rays mildly and pleasantly over the floor of the
room. Just as the mother was going to her work,
the sick girl fixed her gaze on the lowest pane of
the window. "Mother," she exclaimed, "what can
that little green thing be that peeps in at the
window? It is moving in the wind."</p>

<p>The mother stepped to the window and half
opened it. "Oh!" she said, "there is actually a
little pea that has taken root and is putting out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
its green leaves. How could it have got into this
crack? Well, now, here is a little garden for you
to amuse yourself with." So the bed of the sick
girl was drawn nearer to the window, that she
might see the budding plant; and the mother
went forth to her work.</p>

<p>"Mother, I believe I shall get well," said the
sick child in the evening. "The sun has shone
in here so bright and warm to-day, and the little
pea is growing so fast, that I feel better, too, and
think I shall get up and go out into the warm
sunshine again."</p>

<p>"God grant it!" said the mother, but she did
not believe it would be so. She took a little stick
and propped up the green plant which had given
her daughter such pleasure, so that it might not
be broken by the winds. She tied the piece of
string to the window-sill and to the upper part
of the frame, so that the pea tendrils might have
something to twine round. And the plant shot
up so fast that one could almost see it grow
from day to day.</p>

<p>"A flower is really coming," said the mother
one morning. At last she was beginning to let<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
herself hope that her little sick daughter might
indeed recover. She remembered that for some
time the child had spoken more cheerfully, and
that during the last few days she had raised herself
in bed in the morning to look with sparkling
eyes at her little garden which contained but a
single pea plant.</p>

<p>A week later the invalid sat up by the open
window a whole hour, feeling quite happy in the
warm sunshine, while outside grew the little plant,
and on it a pink pea blossom in full bloom. The
little maiden bent down and gently kissed the
delicate leaves. This day was like a festival to her.</p>

<p>"Our heavenly Father himself has planted that
pea and made it grow and flourish, to bring joy
to you and hope to me, my blessed child," said
the happy mother, and she smiled at the flower
as if it had been an angel from God.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 336px;">
<img src="images/p027i.png" width="336" height="500" alt="On it a pink pea blossom ... in full bloom." title="" />
</div>

<p>But what became of the other peas? Why, the
one who flew out into the wide world and said,
"Catch me if you can," fell into a gutter on the
roof of a house and ended his travels in the crop
of a pigeon. The two lazy ones were carried quite
as far and were of some use, for they also were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
eaten by pigeons; but the fourth, who wanted to
reach the sun, fell into a sink and lay there in the
dirty water for days and weeks, till he had swelled
to a great size.</p>

<p>"I am getting beautifully fat," said the pea;
"I expect I shall burst at last; no pea could do
more than that, I think. I am the most remarkable
of all the five that were in the shell." And
the sink agreed with the pea.</p>

<p>But the young girl, with sparkling eyes and the
rosy hue of health upon her cheeks, stood at the
open garret window and, folding her thin hands
over the pea blossom, thanked God for what He
had done.</p>

</div>


<h2>THE STORKS</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 99px;">
<img src="images/drop-o.png" width="99" height="100" alt="O" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'>N the last house in the village there
lay a stork's nest. The mother stork sat
in it with her four little ones, who were
stretching out their heads with their pointed black
bills that had not yet turned red. At a little distance,
on the top of the roof, stood the father
stork, bolt upright and as stiff as could be. That
he might not appear quite idle while standing
sentry, he had drawn one leg up under him, as is
the manner of storks. One might have taken him
to be carved in marble, so still did he stand.</div>

<p>"It must look very grand for my wife to have a
sentinel to guard her nest," he thought. "They
can't know that I am her husband and will, of
course, conclude that I am commanded to stand
here by her nest. It looks aristocratic!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>Below, in the street, a crowd of children were
playing. When they chanced to catch sight of
the storks, one of the boldest of the boys began
to sing the old song about the stork. The others
soon joined him, but each sang the words that he
happened to have heard. This is one of the ways:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Stork, stork, fly away;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Stand not on one leg to-day.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Thy dear wife sits in the nest,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">To lull the little ones to rest.</span><br />
<br />
"There's a halter for one,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">There's a stake for another,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">For the third there's a gun,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And a spit for his brother!"</span><br />
</div>

<p>"Only listen," said the young storks, "to what
the boys are singing. Do you hear them say
we're to be hanged and shot?"</p>

<p>"Don't listen to what they say; if you don't
mind, it won't hurt you," said the mother.</p>

<p>But the boys went on singing, and pointed
mockingly at the sentinel stork. Only one boy,
whom they called Peter, said it was a shame to
make game of animals, and he would not join in
the singing at all.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>The mother stork tried to comfort her young
ones. "Don't mind them," she said; "see how
quiet your father stands on one leg there."</p>

<p>"But we are afraid," said the little ones, drawing
back their beaks into the nest.</p>

<p>The children assembled again on the next day,
and no sooner did they see the storks than they
again began their song:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"The first will be hanged,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The second be hit."</span><br />
</div>

<p>"Tell us, are we to be hanged and burned?"
asked the young storks.</p>

<p>"No, no; certainly not," replied the mother.
"You are to learn to fly, and then we shall pay
a visit to the frogs. They will bow to us in the
water and sing 'Croak! croak!' and we shall eat
them up, and that will be a great treat."</p>

<p>"And then what?" questioned the young storks.</p>

<p>"Oh, then all the storks in the land will assemble,
and the autumn sports will begin; only
then one must be able to fly well, for that is very
important. Whoever does not fly as he should
will be pierced to death by the general's beak, so
mind that you learn well, when the drill begins."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, but then, after that, we shall be killed,
as the boys say. Hark! they are singing it
again."</p>

<p>"Attend to me and not to them," said the
mother stork. "After the great review we shall
fly away to warm countries, far from here, over
hills and forests. To Egypt we shall fly, where
are the three-cornered houses of stone, one point
of which reaches to the clouds; they are called
pyramids and are older than a stork can imagine.
In that same land there is a river which overflows
its banks and turns the whole country into mire.
We shall go into the mire and eat frogs."</p>

<p>"Oh! oh!" exclaimed all the youngsters.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is indeed a delightful place. We need
do nothing all day long but eat; and while we
are feasting there so comfortably, in this country
there is not a green leaf left on the trees. It is so
cold here that the very clouds freeze in lumps
or fall down in little white rags." It was hail and
snow that she meant, but she did not know how
to say it better.</p>

<p>"And will the naughty boys freeze in lumps?"
asked the young storks.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, they will not freeze in lumps, but they
will come near it, and they will sit moping and
cowering in gloomy rooms while you are flying
about in foreign lands, amid bright flowers and
warm sunshine."</p>

<p>Some time passed, and the nestlings had grown
so large and strong that they could stand upright
in the nest and look all about them. Every day
the father stork came with delicious frogs, nice
little snakes, and other such dainties that storks
delight in. How funny it was to see the clever
feats he performed to amuse them! He would
lay his head right round upon his tail; and
sometimes he would clatter with his beak, as
if it were a little rattle; or he would tell them
stories, all relating to swamps and fens.</p>

<p>"Come, children," said the mother stork one
day, "now you must learn to fly." And all the
four young storks had to go out on the ridge of
the roof. How they did totter and stagger about!
They tried to balance themselves with their wings,
but came very near falling to the ground.</p>

<p>"Look at me!" said the mother. "This is the
way to hold your head. And thus you must place<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
your feet. Left! right! left! right! that's what
will help you on in the world."</p>

<p>Then she flew a little way, and the young ones
took a clumsy little leap. Bump! plump! down
they fell, for their bodies were still too heavy
for them.</p>

<p>"I will not fly," said one of the young storks,
as he crept back to the nest. "I don't care about
going to warm countries."</p>

<p>"Do you want to stay here and freeze when
the winter comes? Will you wait till the boys
come to hang, to burn, or to roast you? Well,
then, I'll call them."</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" cried the timid stork, hopping back
to the roof with the rest.</p>

<p>By the third day they actually began to fly a
little. Then they had no doubt that they could
soar or hover in the air, upborne by their wings.
And this they attempted to do, but down they
fell, flapping their wings as fast as they could.</p>

<p>Again the boys came to the street, singing
their song, "Storks, storks, fly home and rest."</p>

<p>"Shall we fly down and peck them?" asked
the young ones.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, leave them alone. Attend to me; that's
far more important. One&mdash;two&mdash;three! now we
fly round to the right. One&mdash;two&mdash;three! now
to the left, round the chimney. There! that was
very good. That last flap with your wings and
the kick with your feet were so graceful and
proper that to-morrow you shall fly with me to
the marsh. Several of the nicest stork families
will be there with their children. Let me see that
mine are the best bred of all. Carry your heads
high and mind you strut about proudly, for that
looks well and helps to make one respected."</p>

<p>"But shall we not take revenge upon the
naughty boys?" asked the young storks.</p>

<p>"No, no; let them scream away, as much as
they please. You are to fly up to the clouds and
away to the land of the pyramids, while they are
freezing and can neither see a green leaf nor
taste a sweet apple."</p>

<p>"But we will revenge ourselves," they whispered
one to another. And then the training began again.</p>

<p>Among all the children down in the street the
one that seemed most bent upon singing the song
that made game of the storks was the boy who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
had begun it, and he was a little fellow hardly
more than six years old. The young storks, to be
sure, thought he was at least a hundred, for he
was much bigger than their parents, and, besides,
what did they know about the ages of either children
or grown men? Their whole vengeance was
to be aimed at this one boy. It was always he
who began the song and persisted in mocking
them. The young storks were very angry, and as
they grew larger they also grew less patient
under insult, and their mother was at last obliged
to promise them that they might be revenged&mdash;but
not until the day of their departure.</p>

<p>"We must first see how you carry yourselves
at the great review. If you do so badly that the
general runs his beak through you, then the boys
will be in the right&mdash;at least in one way. We
must wait and see!"</p>

<p>"Yes, you shall see!" cried all the young
storks; and they took the greatest pains, practicing
every day, until they flew so evenly and so
lightly that it was a pleasure to see them.</p>

<p>The autumn now set in; all the storks began
to assemble, in order to start for the warm<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
countries and leave winter behind them. And
such exercises as there were! Young fledglings
were set to fly over forests and villages, to see
if they were equal to the long journey that was
before them. So well did our young storks acquit
themselves, that, as a proof of the satisfaction
they had given, the mark they got was, "Remarkably
well," with a present of a frog and a snake,
which they lost no time in eating.</p>

<p>"Now," said they, "we will be revenged."</p>

<p>"Yes, certainly," said their mother; "and I have
thought of a way that will surely be the fairest. I
know a pond where all the little human children
lie till the stork comes to take them to their
parents. There lie the pretty little babies, dreaming
more sweetly than they ever dream afterwards.
All the parents are wishing for one of
these little ones, and the children all want a sister
or a brother. Now we'll fly to the pond and bring
back a baby for every child who did not sing the
naughty song that made game of the storks."</p>

<p>"But the very naughty boy who was the first
to begin the song," cried the young storks, "what
shall we do with him?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>"There is a little dead child in the pond&mdash;one
that has dreamed itself to death. We will bring
that for him. Then he will cry because we have
brought a little dead brother to him.</p>

<p>"But that good boy,&mdash;you have not forgotten
him!&mdash;the one who said it was a shame to mock
at the animals; for him we will bring both a
brother and a sister. And because his name is
Peter, all of you shall be called Peter, too."</p>

<p>All was done as the mother had said; the
storks were named Peter, and so they are called
to this day.</p>

<h2>THE WILD SWANS</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 71px;">
<img src="images/drop-f.png" width="71" height="100" alt="F" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'>AR away, in the land to which the swallows
fly when it is winter, dwelt a king who had
eleven sons, and one daughter, named Eliza.</div>

<p>The eleven brothers were princes, and each
went to school with a star on his breast and a
sword by his side. They wrote with diamond
pencils on golden slates and learned their lessons
so quickly and read so easily that every one knew
they were princes. Their sister Eliza sat on a
little stool of plate-glass and had a book full of
pictures, which had cost as much as half a kingdom.</p>

<p>Happy, indeed, were these children; but they
were not long to remain so, for their father, the
king, married a queen who did not love the children,
and who proved to be a wicked sorceress.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>The queen began to show her unkindness the
very first day. While the great festivities were
taking place in the palace, the children played at
receiving company; but the queen, instead of
sending them the cakes and apples that were left
from the feast, as was customary, gave them some
sand in a teacup and told them to pretend it
was something good. The next week she sent
the little Eliza into the country to a peasant and
his wife. Then she told the king so many untrue
things about the young princes that he
gave himself no more trouble about them.</p>

<p>"Go out into the world and look after yourselves,"
said the queen. "Fly like great birds without
a voice." But she could not make it so bad
for them as she would have liked, for they were
turned into eleven beautiful wild swans.</p>

<p>With a strange cry, they flew through the
windows of the palace, over the park, to the forest
beyond. It was yet early morning when they
passed the peasant's cottage where their sister lay
asleep in her room. They hovered over the roof,
twisting their long necks and flapping their wings,
but no one heard them or saw them, so they at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
last flew away, high up in the clouds, and over the
wide world they sped till they came to a thick,
dark wood, which stretched far away to the seashore.</p>

<p>Poor little Eliza was alone in the peasant's room
playing with a green leaf, for she had no other
playthings. She pierced a hole in the leaf, and
when she looked through it at the sun she seemed
to see her brothers' clear eyes, and when the warm
sun shone on her cheeks she thought of all the
kisses they had given her.</p>

<p>One day passed just like another. Sometimes
the winds rustled through the leaves of the rosebush
and whispered to the roses, "Who can be
more beautiful than you?" And the roses would
shake their heads and say, "Eliza is." And when
the old woman sat at the cottage door on Sunday
and read her hymn book, the wind would flutter
the leaves and say to the book, "Who can be
more pious than you?" And then the hymn book
would answer, "Eliza." And the roses and the
hymn book told the truth.</p>

<p>When she was fifteen she returned home, but
because she was so beautiful the witch-queen
became full of spite and hatred toward her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
Willingly would she have turned her into a swan
like her brothers, but she did not dare to do so
for fear of the king.</p>

<p>Early one morning the queen went into the
bathroom; it was built of marble and had soft
cushions trimmed with the most beautiful tapestry.
She took three toads with her, and kissed them,
saying to the first, "When Eliza comes to bathe
seat yourself upon her head, that she may become
as stupid as you are." To the second toad she
said, "Place yourself on her forehead, that she
may become as ugly as you are, and that her
friends may not know her." "Rest on her heart,"
she whispered to the third; "then she will have
evil inclinations and suffer because of them." So
she put the toads into the clear water, which at
once turned green. She next called Eliza and
helped her undress and get into the bath.</p>

<p>As Eliza dipped her head under the water one
of the toads sat on her hair, a second on her forehead,
and a third on her breast. But she did not
seem to notice them, and when she rose from the
water there were three red poppies floating upon
it. Had not the creatures been venomous or had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
they not been kissed by the witch, they would
have become red roses. At all events they became
flowers, because they had rested on Eliza's head
and on her heart. She was too good and too innocent
for sorcery to have any power over her.</p>

<p>When the wicked queen saw this, she rubbed
Eliza's face with walnut juice, so that she was
quite brown; then she tangled her beautiful hair
and smeared it with disgusting ointment until it
was quite impossible to recognize her.</p>

<p>The king was shocked, and declared she was
not his daughter. No one but the watchdog and
the swallows knew her, and they were only poor
animals and could say nothing. Then poor Eliza
wept and thought of her eleven brothers who
were far away. Sorrowfully she stole from the
palace and walked the whole day over fields and
moors, till she came to the great forest. She
knew not in what direction to go, but she was
so unhappy and longed so for her brothers, who,
like herself, had been driven out into the world,
that she was determined to seek them.</p>

<p>She had been in the wood only a short time
when night came on and she quite lost the path;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
so she laid herself down on the soft moss, offered
up her evening prayer, and leaned her head against
the stump of a tree. All nature was silent, and
the soft, mild air fanned her forehead. The light
of hundreds of glowworms shone amidst the grass
and the moss like green fire, and if she touched
a twig with her hand, ever so lightly, the brilliant
insects fell down around her like shooting stars.</p>

<p>All night long she dreamed of her brothers.
She thought they were all children again, playing
together. She saw them writing with their
diamond pencils on golden slates, while she
looked at the beautiful picture book which had
cost half a kingdom. They were not writing lines
and letters, as they used to do, but descriptions
of the noble deeds they had performed and of
all that they had discovered and seen. In the
picture book, too, everything was living. The
birds sang, and the people came out of the book
and spoke to Eliza and her brothers; but as the
leaves were turned over they darted back again
to their places, that all might be in order.</p>

<p>When she awoke, the sun was high in the
heavens. She could not see it, for the lofty trees<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
spread their branches thickly overhead, but its
gleams here and there shone through the leaves
like a gauzy golden mist. There was a sweet
fragrance from the fresh verdure, and the birds
came near and almost perched on her shoulders.
She heard water rippling from a number of
springs, all flowing into a lake with golden sands.
Bushes grew thickly round the lake, and at one
spot, where an opening had been made by a deer,
Eliza went down to the water.</p>

<p>The lake was so clear that had not the wind
rustled the branches of the trees and the bushes
so that they moved, they would have seemed
painted in the depths of the lake; for every leaf,
whether in the shade or in the sunshine, was
reflected in the water.</p>

<p>When Eliza saw her own face she was quite
terrified at finding it so brown and ugly, but
after she had wet her little hand and rubbed her
eyes and forehead, the white skin gleamed forth
once more; and when she had undressed and
dipped herself in the fresh water, a more beautiful
king's daughter could not have been found
anywhere in the wide world.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as she had dressed herself again and
braided her long hair, she went to the bubbling
spring and drank some water out of the hollow
of her hand. Then she wandered far into the forest,
not knowing whither she went. She thought
of her brothers and of her father and mother and
felt sure that God would not forsake her. It is
God who makes the wild apples grow in the wood
to satisfy the hungry, and He now showed her
one of these trees, which was so loaded with fruit
that the boughs bent beneath the weight. Here
she ate her noonday meal, and then placing props
under the boughs, she went into the gloomiest
depths of the forest.</p>

<p>It was so still that she could hear the sound of
her own footsteps, as well as the rustling of every
withered leaf which she crushed under her feet.
Not a bird was to be seen, not a sunbeam could
penetrate the large, dark boughs of the trees.
The lofty trunks stood so close together that
when she looked before her it seemed as if she
were enclosed within trelliswork. Here was such
solitude as she had never known before!</p>

<p>The night was very dark. Not a glowworm<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
was glittering in the moss. Sorrowfully Eliza laid
herself down to sleep. After a while it seemed to
her as if the branches of the trees parted over
her head and the mild eyes of angels looked down
upon her from heaven.</p>

<p>In the morning, when she awoke, she knew
not whether this had really been so or whether
she had dreamed it. She continued her wandering,
but she had not gone far when she met an
old woman who had berries in her basket and
who gave her a few to eat. Eliza asked her if
she had not seen eleven princes riding through
the forest.</p>

<p>"No," replied the old woman, "but I saw yesterday
eleven swans with gold crowns on their
heads, swimming in the river close by." Then
she led Eliza a little distance to a sloping bank,
at the foot of which ran a little river. The trees
on its banks stretched their long leafy branches
across the water toward each other, and where
they did not meet naturally the roots had torn
themselves away from the ground, so that the
branches might mingle their foliage as they
hung over the water.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>Eliza bade the old woman farewell and walked
by the flowing river till she reached the shore
of the open sea. And there, before her eyes, lay
the glorious ocean, but not a sail appeared on its
surface; not even a boat could be seen. How was
she to go farther? She noticed how the countless
pebbles on the shore had been smoothed and
rounded by the action of the water. Glass, iron,
stones, everything that lay there mingled together,
had been shaped by the same power until they
were as smooth as her own delicate hand.</p>

<p>"The water rolls on without weariness," she
said, "till all that is hard becomes smooth; so
will I be unwearied in my task. Thanks for your
lesson, bright rolling waves; my heart tells me
you will one day lead me to my dear brothers."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 340px;">
<img src="images/p049i.png" width="340" height="500" alt="Eliza asked her if she had not seen eleven princes riding through the forest...." title="" />
</div>

<p>On the foam-covered seaweeds lay eleven white
swan feathers, which she gathered and carried with
her. Drops of water lay upon them; whether
they were dewdrops or tears no one could say.
It was lonely on the seashore, but she did not
know it, for the ever-moving sea showed more
changes in a few hours than the most varying
lake could produce in a whole year. When a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
black, heavy cloud arose, it was as if the sea
said, "I can look dark and angry too"; and then
the wind blew, and the waves turned to white
foam as they rolled. When the wind slept and
the clouds glowed with the red sunset, the sea
looked like a rose leaf. Sometimes it became green
and sometimes white. But, however quietly it lay,
the waves were always restless on the shore and
rose and fell like the breast of a sleeping child.</p>

<p>When the sun was about to set, Eliza saw
eleven white swans, with golden crowns on their
heads, flying toward the land, one behind the
other, like a long white ribbon. She went down
the slope from the shore and hid herself behind
the bushes. The swans alighted quite close to
her, flapping their great white wings. As soon
as the sun had disappeared under the water, the
feathers of the swans fell off and eleven beautiful
princes, Eliza's brothers, stood near her.</p>

<p>She uttered a loud cry, for, although they were
very much changed, she knew them immediately.
She sprang into their arms and called them each
by name. Very happy the princes were to see
their little sister again; they knew her, although<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
she had grown so tall and beautiful. They laughed
and wept and told each other how cruelly they
had been treated by their stepmother.</p>

<p>"We brothers," said the eldest, "fly about as
wild swans while the sun is in the sky, but as
soon as it sinks behind the hills we recover our
human shape. Therefore we must always be near
a resting place before sunset; for if we were flying
toward the clouds when we recovered our human
form, we should sink deep into the sea.</p>

<p>"We do not dwell here, but in a land just as
fair that lies far across the ocean; the way is
long, and there is no island upon which we can
pass the night&mdash;nothing but a little rock rising
out of the sea, upon which, even crowded together,
we can scarcely stand with safety. If the sea is
rough, the foam dashes over us; yet we thank
God for this rock. We have passed whole nights
upon it, or we should never have reached our
beloved fatherland, for our flight across the sea
occupies two of the longest days in the year.</p>

<p>"We have permission to visit our home once
every year and to remain eleven days. Then we
fly across the forest to look once more at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
palace where our father dwells and where we
were born, and at the church beneath whose
shade our mother lies buried. The very trees
and bushes here seem related to us. The wild
horses leap over the plains as we have seen them
in our childhood. The charcoal burners sing the
old songs to which we have danced as children.
This is our fatherland, to which we are drawn by
loving ties; and here we have found you, our dear
little sister. Two days longer we can remain here,
and then we must fly away to a beautiful land
which is not our home. How can we take you
with us? We have neither ship nor boat."</p>

<p>"How can I break this spell?" asked the sister.
And they talked about it nearly the whole
night, slumbering only a few hours.</p>

<p>Eliza was awakened by the rustling of the
wings of swans soaring above her. Her brothers
were again changed to swans. They flew in
circles, wider and wider, till they were far away;
but one of them, the youngest, remained behind
and laid his head in his sister's lap, while she
stroked his wings. They remained together the
whole day.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>Towards evening the rest came back, and as
the sun went down they resumed their natural
forms. "To-morrow," said one, "we shall fly
away, not to return again till a whole year has
passed. But we cannot leave you here. Have
you courage to go with us? My arm is strong
enough to carry you through the wood, and will
not all our wings be strong enough to bear you
over the sea?"</p>

<p>"Yes, take me with you," said Eliza. They
spent the whole night in weaving a large, strong
net of the pliant willow and rushes. On this Eliza
laid herself down to sleep, and when the sun rose
and her brothers again became wild swans, they
took up the net with their beaks, and flew up to
the clouds with their dear sister, who still slept.
When the sunbeams fell on her face, one of the
swans soared over her head so that his broad
wings might shade her.</p>

<p>They were far from the land when Eliza awoke.
She thought she must still be dreaming, it seemed
so strange to feel herself being carried high in the
air over the sea. By her side lay a branch full of
beautiful ripe berries and a bundle of sweet-tasting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
roots; the youngest of her brothers had gathered
them and placed them there. She smiled her
thanks to him; she knew it was the same one
that was hovering over her to shade her with his
wings. They were now so high that a large ship
beneath them looked like a white sea gull skimming
the waves. A great cloud floating behind
them appeared like a vast mountain, and upon it
Eliza saw her own shadow and those of the eleven
swans, like gigantic flying things. Altogether it
formed a more beautiful picture than she had ever
before seen; but as the sun rose higher and the
clouds were left behind, the picture vanished.</p>

<p>Onward the whole day they flew through the
air like winged arrows, yet more slowly than
usual, for they had their sister to carry. The
weather grew threatening, and Eliza watched the
sinking sun with great anxiety, for the little rock
in the ocean was not yet in sight. It seemed to
her as if the swans were exerting themselves to
the utmost. Alas! she was the cause of their not
advancing more quickly. When the sun set they
would change to men, fall into the sea, and be
drowned.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>Then she offered a prayer from her inmost
heart, but still no rock appeared. Dark clouds
came nearer, the gusts of wind told of the coming
storm, while from a thick, heavy mass of
clouds the lightning burst forth, flash after flash.
The sun had reached the edge of the sea, when
the swans darted down so swiftly that Eliza's
heart trembled; she believed they were falling,
but they again soared onward.</p>

<p>Presently, and by this time the sun was half
hidden by the waves, she caught sight of the
rock just below them. It did not look larger than
a seal's head thrust out of the water. The sun
sank so rapidly that at the moment their feet
touched the rock it shone only like a star, and
at last disappeared like the dying spark in a piece
of burnt paper. Her brothers stood close around
her with arms linked together, for there was not
the smallest space to spare. The sea dashed
against the rock and covered them with spray.
The heavens were lighted up with continual
flashes, and thunder rolled from the clouds. But
the sister and brothers stood holding each other's
hands, and singing hymns.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>In the early dawn the air became calm and
still, and at sunrise the swans flew away from the
rock, bearing their sister with them. The sea was
still rough, and from their great height the white
foam on the dark-green waves looked like millions
of swans swimming on the water. As the
sun rose higher, Eliza saw before her, floating
in the air, a range of mountains with shining
masses of ice on their summits. In the center
rose a castle that seemed a mile long, with rows
of columns rising one above another, while around
it palm trees waved and flowers as large as
mill wheels bloomed. She asked if this was the
land to which they were hastening. The swans
shook their heads, for what she beheld were the
beautiful, ever-changing cloud-palaces of the Fata
Morgana, into which no mortal can enter.</p>

<p>Eliza was still gazing at the scene, when mountains,
forests, and castles melted away, and twenty
stately churches rose in their stead, with high
towers and pointed Gothic windows. She even
fancied she could hear the tones of the organ,
but it was the music of the murmuring sea. As
they drew nearer to the churches, these too were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
changed and became a fleet of ships, which seemed
to be sailing beneath her; but when she looked
again she saw only a sea mist gliding over the
ocean.</p>

<p>One scene melted into another, until at last
she saw the real land to which they were bound,
with its blue mountains, its cedar forests, and
its cities and palaces. Long before the sun went
down she was sitting on a rock in front of a large
cave, the floor of which was overgrown with delicate
green creeping plants, like an embroidered
carpet.</p>

<p>"Now we shall expect to hear what you dream
of to-night," said the youngest brother, as he
showed his sister her bedroom.</p>

<p>"Heaven grant that I may dream how to release
you!" she replied. And this thought took such
hold upon her mind that she prayed earnestly
to God for help, and even in her sleep she continued
to pray. Then it seemed to her that she
was flying high in the air toward the cloudy
palace of the Fata Morgana, and that a fairy
came out to meet her, radiant and beautiful,
yet much like the old woman who had given<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
her berries in the wood, and who had told her of
the swans with golden crowns on their heads.</p>

<p>"Your brothers can be released," said she, "if
you only have courage and perseverance. Water
is softer than your own delicate hands, and yet
it polishes and shapes stones. But it feels no
pain such as your fingers will feel; it has no soul
and cannot suffer such agony and torment as you
will have to endure. Do you see the stinging
nettle which I hold in my hand? Quantities of
the same sort grow round the cave in which you
sleep, but only these, and those that grow on the
graves of a churchyard, will be of any use to you.
These you must gather, even while they burn
blisters on your hands. Break them to pieces
with your hands and feet, and they will become
flax, from which you must spin and weave eleven
coats with long sleeves; if these are then thrown
over the eleven swans, the spell will be broken.
But remember well, that from the moment you
commence your task until it is finished, even
though it occupy years of your life, you must not
speak. The first word you utter will pierce the
hearts of your brothers like a deadly dagger.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
Their lives hang upon your tongue. Remember
all that I have told you."</p>

<p>And as she finished speaking, she touched
Eliza's hand lightly with the nettle, and a pain
as of burning fire awoke her.</p>

<p>It was broad daylight, and near her lay a nettle
like the one she had seen in her dream. She fell
on her knees and offered thanks to God. Then
she went forth from the cave to begin work with
her delicate hands. She groped in amongst the
ugly nettles, which burned great blisters on her
hands and arms, but she determined to bear the
pain gladly if she could only release her dear
brothers. So she bruised the nettles with her
bare feet and spun the flax.</p>

<p>At sunset her brothers returned, and were
much frightened when she did not speak. They
believed her to be under the spell of some new
sorcery, but when they saw her hands they understood
what she was doing in their behalf. The
youngest brother wept, and where his tears
touched her the pain ceased and the burning
blisters vanished. Eliza kept to her work all
night, for she could not rest till she had released<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
her brothers. During the whole of the following
day, while her brothers were absent, she sat in
solitude, but never before had the time flown so
quickly.</p>

<p>One coat was already finished and she had
begun the second, when she heard a huntsman's
horn and was struck with fear. As the sound
came nearer and nearer, she also heard dogs
barking, and fled with terror into the cave. She
hastily bound together the nettles she had
gathered, and sat upon them. In a moment there
came bounding toward her out of the ravine a
great dog, and then another and another; they
ran back and forth barking furiously, until in a
few minutes all the huntsmen stood before the
cave. The handsomest of them was the king of
the country, who, when he saw the beautiful
maiden, advanced toward her, saying, "How did
you come here, my sweet child?"</p>

<p>Eliza shook her head. She dared not speak,
for it would cost her brothers their deliverance
and their lives. And she hid her hands under
her apron, so that the king might not see how
she was suffering.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come with me," he said; "here you cannot
remain. If you are as good as you are beautiful,
I will dress you in silk and velvet, I will place a
golden crown on your head, and you shall rule
and make your home in my richest castle." Then
he lifted her onto his horse. She wept and wrung
her hands, but the king said: "I wish only your
happiness. A time will come when you will
thank me for this."</p>

<p>He galloped away over the mountains, holding
her before him on his horse, and the hunters followed
behind them. As the sun went down they
approached a fair, royal city, with churches and
cupolas. On arriving at the castle, the king led
her into marble halls, where large fountains
played and where the walls and the ceilings were
covered with rich paintings. But she had no
eyes for all these glorious sights; she could only
mourn and weep. Patiently she allowed the
women to array her in royal robes, to weave
pearls in her hair, and to draw soft gloves over
her blistered fingers. As she stood arrayed in
her rich dress, she looked so dazzlingly beautiful
that the court bowed low in her presence.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the king declared his intention of making
her his bride, but the archbishop shook his
head and whispered that the fair young maiden
was only a witch, who had blinded the king's eyes
and ensnared his heart. The king would not listen
to him, however, and ordered the music to
sound, the daintiest dishes to be served, and the
loveliest maidens to dance before them.</p>

<p>Afterwards he led her through fragrant gardens
and lofty halls, but not a smile appeared on her
lips or sparkled in her eyes. She looked the very
picture of grief. Then the king opened the door of
a little chamber in which she was to sleep. It was
adorned with rich green tapestry and resembled
the cave in which he had found her. On the floor
lay the bundle of flax which she had spun from the
nettles, and under the ceiling hung the coat she had
made. These things had been brought away from
the cave as curiosities, by one of the huntsmen.</p>

<p>"Here you can dream yourself back again in
the old home in the cave," said the king; "here is
the work with which you employed yourself. It
will amuse you now, in the midst of all this
splendor, to think of that time."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>When Eliza saw all these things which lay so
near her heart, a smile played around her mouth,
and the crimson blood rushed to her cheeks. The
thought of her brothers and their release made
her so joyful that she kissed the king's hand.
Then he pressed her to his heart.</p>

<p>Very soon the joyous church bells announced
the marriage feast; the beautiful dumb girl of the
woods was to be made queen of the country. A
single word would cost her brothers their lives,
but she loved the kind, handsome king, who did
everything to make her happy, more and more
each day; she loved him with her whole heart,
and her eyes beamed with the love she dared not
speak. Oh! if she could only confide in him and
tell him of her grief. But dumb she must remain
till her task was finished.</p>

<p>Therefore at night she crept away into her
little chamber which had been decked out to look
like the cave and quickly wove one coat after another.
But when she began the seventh, she found
she had no more flax. She knew that the nettles
she wanted to use grew in the churchyard and
that she must pluck them herself. How should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
she get out there? "Oh, what is the pain in my
fingers to the torment which my heart endures?"
thought she. "I must venture; I shall not be
denied help from heaven."</p>

<p>Then with a trembling heart, as if she were
about to perform a wicked deed, Eliza crept into
the garden in the broad moonlight, and passed
through the narrow walks and the deserted streets
till she reached the churchyard. She prayed silently,
gathered the burning nettles, and carried
them home with her to the castle.</p>

<p>One person only had seen her, and that was
the archbishop&mdash;he was awake while others
slept. Now he felt sure that his suspicions were
correct; all was not right with the queen; she
was a witch and had bewitched the king and all
the people. Secretly he told the king what he
had seen and what he feared, and as the hard
words came from his tongue, the carved images
of the saints shook their heads as if they would
say, "It is not so; Eliza is innocent."</p>

<p>But the archbishop interpreted it in another
way; he believed that they witnessed against her
and were shaking their heads at her wickedness.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
Two tears rolled down the king's cheeks. He
went home with doubt in his heart, and at night
pretended to sleep. But no real sleep came to his
eyes, for every night he saw Eliza get up and disappear
from her chamber. Day by day his brow
became darker, and Eliza saw it, and although
she did not understand the reason, it alarmed her
and made her heart tremble for her brothers. Her
hot tears glittered like pearls on the regal velvet
and diamonds, while all who saw her were wishing
they could be queen.</p>

<p>In the meantime she had almost finished her
task; only one of her brothers' coats was wanting,
but she had no flax left and not a single nettle.
Once more only, and for the last time, must she
venture to the churchyard and pluck a few handfuls.
She went, and the king and the archbishop
followed her. The king turned away his head and
said, "The people must condemn her." Quickly
she was condemned to suffer death by fire.</p>

<p>Away from the gorgeous regal halls she was
led to a dark, dreary cell, where the wind whistled
through the iron bars. Instead of the velvet and
silk dresses, they gave her the ten coats which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
she had woven, to cover her, and the bundle of
nettles for a pillow. But they could have given her
nothing that would have pleased her more. She
continued her task with joy and prayed for help,
while the street boys sang jeering songs about
her and not a soul comforted her with a kind
word.</p>

<p>Toward evening she heard at the grating the
flutter of a swan's wing; it was her youngest
brother. He had found his sister, and she sobbed
for joy, although she knew that probably this
was the last night she had to live. Still, she
had hope, for her task was almost finished and
her brothers were come.</p>

<p>Then the archbishop arrived, to be with her
during her last hours as he had promised the
king. She shook her head and begged him, by
looks and gestures, not to stay; for in this night
she knew she must finish her task, otherwise
all her pain and tears and sleepless nights would
have been suffered in vain. The archbishop
withdrew, uttering bitter words against her, but
she knew that she was innocent and diligently
continued her work.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>Little mice ran about the floor, dragging the
nettles to her feet, to help as much as they could;
and a thrush, sitting outside the grating of the
window, sang to her the whole night long as
sweetly as possible, to keep up her spirits.</p>

<p>It was still twilight, and at least an hour
before sunrise, when the eleven brothers stood
at the castle gate and demanded to be brought
before the king. They were told it could not be;
it was yet night; the king slept and could not be
disturbed. They threatened, they entreated, until
the guard appeared, and even the king himself,
inquiring what all the noise meant. At this
moment the sun rose, and the eleven brothers
were seen no more, but eleven wild swans flew
away over the castle.</p>

<p>Now all the people came streaming forth from
the gates of the city to see the witch burned.
An old horse drew the cart on which she sat.
They had dressed her in a garment of coarse
sackcloth. Her lovely hair hung loose on her
shoulders, her cheeks were deadly pale, her lips
moved silently while her fingers still worked at
the green flax. Even on the way to death she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
would not give up her task. The ten finished
coats lay at her feet; she was working hard at
the eleventh, while the mob jeered her and said:
"See the witch; how she mutters! She has no
hymn book in her hand; she sits there with her
ugly sorcery. Let us tear it into a thousand
pieces."</p>

<p>They pressed toward her, and doubtless would
have destroyed the coats had not, at that moment,
eleven wild swans flown over her and alighted on
the cart. They flapped their large wings, and the
crowd drew back in alarm.</p>

<p>"It is a sign from Heaven that she is innocent,"
whispered many of them; but they did not
venture to say it aloud.</p>

<p>As the executioner seized her by the hand to
lift her out of the cart, she hastily threw the
eleven coats over the eleven swans, and they
immediately became eleven handsome princes;
but the youngest had a swan's wing instead of
an arm, for she had not been able to finish the
last sleeve of the coat.</p>

<p>"Now I may speak," she exclaimed. "I am
innocent."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the people, who saw what had happened,
bowed to her as before a saint; but she sank unconscious
in her brothers' arms, overcome with
suspense, anguish, and pain.</p>

<p>"Yes, she is innocent," said the eldest brother,
and related all that had taken place. While he
spoke, there rose in the air a fragrance as from
millions of roses. Every piece of fagot in the
pile made to burn her had taken root, and threw
out branches until the whole appeared like a thick
hedge, large and high, covered with roses; while
above all bloomed a white, shining flower that
glittered like a star. This flower the king plucked,
and when he placed it in Eliza's bosom she awoke
from her swoon with peace and happiness in her
heart. Then all the church bells rang of themselves,
and the birds came in great flocks. And
a marriage procession, such as no king had ever
before seen, returned to the castle.</p>

<h2>THE LAST DREAM OF THE OLD OAK</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 38px;">
<img src="images/drop-i.png" width="38" height="100" alt="I" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'>N THE forest, high up on the steep shore and
not far from the open seacoast, stood a very
old oak tree. It was just three hundred and
sixty-five years old, but that long time was to the
tree as the same number of days might be to us.
We wake by day and sleep by night, and then we
have our dreams. It is different with the tree; it
is obliged to keep awake through three seasons of
the year and does not get any sleep till winter
comes. Winter is its time for rest&mdash;its night after
the long day of spring, summer, and autumn.</div>

<p>During many a warm summer, the Ephemeras,
which are flies that exist for only a day, had fluttered
about the old oak, enjoyed life, and felt
happy. And if, for a moment, one of the tiny
creatures rested on the large, fresh leaves, the tree<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
would always say: "Poor little creature! your
whole life consists of but a single day. How very
short! It must be quite melancholy."</p>

<p>"Melancholy! what do you mean?" the little
creature would always reply. "Why do you say
that? Everything around me is so wonderfully
bright and warm and beautiful that it makes me
joyous."</p>

<p>"But only for one day, and then it is all over."</p>

<p>"Over!" repeated the fly; "what is the meaning
of 'all over'? Are you 'all over' too?"</p>

<p>"No, I shall very likely live for thousands of
your days, and my day is whole seasons long; indeed,
it is so long that you could never reckon
it up."</p>

<p>"No? then I don't understand you. You may
have thousands of my days, but I have thousands
of moments in which I can be merry and happy.
Does all the beauty of the world cease when you
die?"</p>

<p>"No," replied the tree; "it will certainly last
much longer, infinitely longer than I can think of."</p>

<p>"Well, then," said the little fly, "we have the
same time to live, only we reckon differently."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
And the little creature danced and floated in the
air, rejoicing in its delicate wings of gauze and
velvet, rejoicing in the balmy breezes laden with
the fragrance from the clover fields and wild
roses, elder blossoms and honeysuckle, and from
the garden hedges of wild thyme, primroses, and
mint. The perfume of all these was so strong
that it almost intoxicated the little fly. The long
and beautiful day had been so full of joy and
sweet delights, that, when the sun sank, the fly felt
tired of all its happiness and enjoyment. Its wings
could sustain it no longer, and gently and slowly
it glided down to the soft, waving blades of grass,
nodded its little head as well as it could, and slept
peacefully and sweetly. The fly was dead.</p>

<p>"Poor little Ephemera!" said the oak; "what
a short life!" And so on every summer day the
dance was repeated, the same questions were asked
and the same answers given, and there was the
same peaceful falling asleep at sunset. This continued
through many generations of Ephemeras,
and all of them felt merry and happy.</p>

<p>The oak remained awake through the morning
of spring, the noon of summer, and the evening<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
of autumn; its time of rest, its night, drew near&mdash;its
winter was coming. Here fell a leaf and
there fell a leaf. Already the storms were singing:
"Good night, good night. We will rock you and
lull you. Go to sleep, go to sleep. We will sing
you to sleep, and shake you to sleep, and it will
do your old twigs good; they will even crackle
with pleasure. Sleep sweetly, sleep sweetly, it is
your three hundred and sixty-fifth night. You are
still very young in the world. Sleep sweetly; the
clouds will drop snow upon you, which will be
your coverlid, warm and sheltering to your feet.
Sweet sleep to you, and pleasant dreams."</p>

<p>And there stood the oak, stripped of all its
leaves, left to rest during the whole of a long
winter, and to dream many dreams of events
that had happened, just as men dream.</p>

<p>The great tree had once been small; indeed,
in its cradle it had been an acorn. According to
human reckoning, it was now in the fourth century
of its existence. It was the largest and best
tree in the forest. Its summit towered above all
the other trees and could be seen far out at sea,
so that it served as a landmark to the sailors. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
had no idea how many eyes looked eagerly for it.
In its topmost branches the wood pigeon built her
nest, and the cuckoo sang his well-known song,
the familiar notes echoing among the boughs;
and in autumn, when the leaves looked like
beaten copper plates, the birds of passage came
and rested on the branches before beginning
their flight across the sea.</p>

<p>But now that it was winter, the tree stood leafless,
so that every one could see how crooked and
bent were the branches that sprang forth from the
trunk. Crows and rooks came by turns and sat
on them, and talked of the hard times that were
beginning, and how difficult it was in winter to
obtain a living.</p>

<p>It was just at the holy Christmas time that the
tree dreamed a dream. The tree had doubtless a
feeling that the festive time had arrived, and in
its dream fancied it heard the bells of the churches
ringing. And yet it seemed to be a beautiful summer's
day, mild and warm. The tree's mighty
summit was crowned with spreading, fresh green
foliage; the sunbeams played among its leaves
and branches, and the air was full of fragrance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
from herb and blossom; painted butterflies chased
each other; the summer flies danced around it as
if the world had been created merely that they
might dance and be merry. All that had happened
to the tree during all the years of its life seemed
to pass before it as if in a festive pageant.</p>

<p>It saw the knights of olden times and noble
ladies ride through the wood on their gallant
steeds, with plumes waving in their hats and with
falcons on their wrists, while the hunting horn
sounded and the dogs barked. It saw hostile
warriors, in colored dress and glittering armor,
with spear and halberd, pitching their tents and
again taking them down; the watchfires blazed,
and men sang and slept under the hospitable
shelter of the tree. It saw lovers meet in quiet
happiness near it in the moonshine, and carve
the initials of their names in the grayish-green
bark of its trunk.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 336px;">
<img src="images/p077i.png" width="336" height="500" alt="It saw lovers meet in quiet happiness near it in the moonshine...." title="" />
</div>

<p>Once, but long years had passed since then,
guitars and &AElig;olian harps had been hung on its
boughs by merry travelers; now they seemed to
hang there again, and their marvelous notes
sounded again. The wood pigeons cooed as if to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
express the feelings of the tree, and the cuckoo
called out to tell it how many summer days it
had yet to live.</p>

<p>Then it appeared to it that new life was thrilling
through every fiber of root and stem and leaf,
rising even to its highest branches. The tree felt
itself stretching and spreading out, while through
the root beneath the earth ran the warm vigor of
life. As it grew higher and still higher and its
strength increased, the topmost boughs became
broader and fuller; and in proportion to its
growth its self-satisfaction increased, and there
came a joyous longing to grow higher and higher&mdash;to
reach even to the warm, bright sun itself.</p>

<p>Already had its topmost branches pierced the
clouds, which floated beneath them like troops
of birds of passage or large white swans; every
leaf seemed gifted with sight, as if it possessed
eyes to see. The stars became visible in broad
daylight, large and sparkling, like clear and gentle
eyes. They brought to the tree's memory the
light that it had seen in the eyes of a child and
in the eyes of lovers who had once met beneath
the branches of the old oak.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>These were wonderful and happy moments for
the old oak, full of peace and joy; and yet amidst
all this happiness, the tree felt a yearning desire
that all the other trees, bushes, herbs, and flowers
beneath it might also be able to rise higher, to
see all this splendor and experience the same
happiness. The grand, majestic oak could not be
quite happy in its enjoyment until all the rest,
both great and small, could share it. And this
feeling of yearning trembled through every branch,
through every leaf, as warmly and fervently as
through a human heart.</p>

<p>The summit of the tree waved to and fro and
bent downwards, as if in its silent longing it
sought something. Then there came to it the
fragrance of thyme and the more powerful scent
of honeysuckle and violets, and the tree fancied
it heard the note of the cuckoo.</p>

<p>At length its longing was satisfied. Up through
the clouds came the green summits of the forest
trees, and the oak watched them rising higher
and higher. Bush and herb shot upward, and
some even tore themselves up by the roots to
rise more quickly. The quickest of all was the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
birch tree. Like a lightning flash the slender
stem shot upwards in a zigzag line, the branches
spreading round it like green gauze and banners.
Every native of the wood, even to the brown and
feathery rushes, grew with the rest, while the
birds ascended with the melody of song. On
a blade of grass that fluttered in the air like a
long green ribbon sat a grasshopper cleaning its
wings with its legs. May beetles hummed, bees
murmured, birds sang&mdash;each in its own way; the
air was filled with the sounds of song and
gladness.</p>

<p>"But where is the little blue flower that grows
by the water, and the purple bellflower, and the
daisy?" asked the oak. "I want them all."</p>

<p>"Here we are; here we are," came the reply in
words and in song.</p>

<p>"But the beautiful thyme of last summer,
where is that? And where are the lilies of the
valley which last year covered the earth with
their bloom, and the wild apple tree with its
fragrant blossoms, and all the glory of the wood,
which has flourished year after year? And where
is even what may have but just been born?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>"We are here; we are here," sounded voices
high up in the air, as if they had flown there
beforehand.</p>

<p>"Why, this is beautiful, too beautiful to be
believed," cried the oak in a joyful tone. "I have
them all here, both great and small; not one has
been forgotten. Can such happiness be imagined?
It seems almost impossible."</p>

<p>"In heaven with the Eternal God it can be
imagined, for all things are possible," sounded
the reply through the air.</p>

<p>And the old tree, as it still grew upwards and
onwards, felt that its roots were loosening themselves
from the earth.</p>

<p>"It is right so; it is best," said the tree. "No
fetters hold me now. I can fly up to the very highest
point in light and glory. And all I love are
with me, both small and great. All&mdash;all are here."</p>

<p>Such was the dream of the old oak at the
holy Christmas time. And while it dreamed, a
mighty storm came rushing over land and sea.
The sea rolled in great billows toward the shore.
A cracking and crushing was heard in the tree.
Its roots were torn from the ground, just at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
moment when in its dream it was being loosened
from the earth. It fell; its three hundred and
sixty-five years were ended like the single day
of the Ephemera.</p>

<p>On the morning of Christmas Day, when the
sun rose, the storm had ceased. From all the
churches sounded the festive bells, and from
every hearth, even of the smallest hut, rose the
smoke into the blue sky, like the smoke from
the festive thank-offerings on the Druids' altars.
The sea gradually became calm, and on board a
great ship that had withstood the tempest during
the night, all the flags were displayed as a token
of joy and festivity.</p>

<p>"The tree is down! the old oak&mdash;our landmark
on the coast!" exclaimed the sailors. "It
must have fallen in the storm of last night. Who
can replace it? Alas! no one." This was the old
tree's funeral oration, brief but well said.</p>

<p>There it lay stretched on the snow-covered
shore, and over it sounded the notes of a song
from the ship&mdash;a song of Christmas joy, of the
redemption of the soul of man, and of eternal
life through Christ.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<div class='poem'>
Sing aloud on this happy morn,<br />
All is fulfilled, for Christ is born;<br />
With songs of joy let us loudly sing,<br />
"Hallelujahs to Christ our King."<br />
</div>

<p>Thus sounded the Christmas carol, and every
one on board the ship felt his thoughts elevated
through the song and the prayer, even as the old
tree had felt lifted up in its last beautiful dream
on that Christmas morn.</p>

<h2>THE PORTUGUESE DUCK</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 101px;">
<img src="images/drop-a.png" width="101" height="100" alt="A" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'> &nbsp; DUCK once arrived from Portugal. There
were some who said she came from
Spain, but that is almost the same thing.
At all events, she was called the Portuguese
duck, and she laid eggs, was killed and cooked,
and that was the end of her.</div>

<p>The ducklings which crept forth from her eggs
were also called Portuguese ducks, and about
that there may be some question. But of all the
family only one remained in the duck yard, which
may be called a farmyard, since the chickens were
admitted to it and the cock strutted about in a
very hostile manner.</p>

<p>"He annoys me with his loud crowing," said
the Portuguese duck, "but still, he's a handsome
bird, there's no denying that, even if he is not a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
duck. He ought to moderate his voice, like those
little birds who are singing in the lime trees over
there in our neighbor's garden&mdash;but that is an art
only acquired in polite society. How sweetly they
sing there; it is quite a pleasure to listen to them!
I call it Portuguese singing. If I only had such a
little singing bird, I'd be as kind and good to him
as a mother, for it's in my Portuguese nature."</p>

<p>While she was speaking, one of the little singing
birds came tumbling head over heels from
the roof into the yard. The cat was after him,
but he had escaped from her with a broken wing
and so came fluttering into the yard. "That's
just like the cat; she's a villain," said the Portuguese
duck. "I remember her ways when I had
children of my own. How can such a creature be
allowed to live and wander about upon the roofs?
I don't think they allow such things in Portugal."</p>

<p>She pitied the little singing bird, and so did all
the other ducks, who were not Portuguese.</p>

<p>"Poor little creature!" they said, one after another,
as they came up. "We can't sing, certainly;
but we have a sounding board, or something of
the kind, within us, though we don't talk about it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>"But I can talk," said the Portuguese duck.
"I'll do something for the little fellow; it's my
duty." So she stepped into the watering trough
and beat her wings upon the water so strongly
that the little bird was nearly drowned. But the
duck meant it kindly. "That is a good deed,"
she said; "I hope the others will take example
from it."</p>

<p>"Tweet, tweet!" said the little bird. One of
his wings was broken and he found it difficult to
shake himself, but he quite understood that the
bath was meant kindly, so he said, "You are
very kind-hearted, madam." But he did not wish
for a second bath.</p>

<p>"I have never thought about my heart," replied
the Portuguese duck; "but I know that I love all
my fellow creatures, except the cat, and nobody
can expect me to love her, for she ate up two of
my ducklings. But pray make yourself at home;
it is easy to make oneself comfortable. I myself
am from a foreign country, as you may see by my
bearing and my feathery dress. My husband is a
native of these parts; he's not of my race, but I
am not proud on that account. If any one here<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
can understand you, I may say positively that I
am that person."</p>

<p>"She's quite full of <i>portulak</i>," said a little common
duck, who was witty. All the common ducks
considered the word "portulak" a good joke, for
it sounded like "Portugal." They nudged each
other and said, "Quack! that was witty!"</p>

<p>Then the other ducks began to notice the newcomer.
"The Portuguese has certainly a great flow
of language," they said to the little bird. "For our
part, we don't care to fill our beaks with such long
words, but we sympathize with you quite as much.
If we don't do anything else, we can walk about
with you everywhere; that is the best we can do."</p>

<p>"You have a lovely voice," said one of the
eldest ducks; "it must be a great satisfaction to
you to be able to give as much pleasure as you
do. I am certainly no judge of your singing, so I
keep my beak shut, which is better than talking
nonsense as others do."</p>

<p>"Don't plague him so," interrupted the Portuguese
duck; "he requires rest and nursing. My
little singing bird, do you wish me to prepare
another bath for you?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, no! no! pray let me be dry," implored
the little bird.</p>

<p>"The water cure is the only remedy for me when
I am not well," said the Portuguese. "Amusement,
too, is very beneficial. The fowls from the neighborhood
will soon be here to pay you a visit.
There are two Cochin-Chinese among them; they
wear feathers on their legs and are well educated.
They have been brought from a great distance,
and consequently I treat them with greater respect
than I do the others."</p>

<p>Then the fowls arrived, and the cock was polite
enough to keep from being rude. "You are a real
songster," he said, "and you do as much with your
little voice as it is possible to do; but more noise
and shrillness is necessary if one wishes others to
know who he is."</p>

<p>The two Chinese were quite enchanted with
the appearance of the singing bird. His feathers
had been much ruffled by his bath, so that he
seemed to them quite like a tiny Chinese fowl.
"He's charming," they said to each other, and
began a conversation with him in whispers, using
the most aristocratic Chinese dialect.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>"We are of the same race as yourself," they
said. "The ducks, even the Portuguese, are all
aquatic birds, as you must have noticed. You do
not know us yet&mdash;very few, even of the fowls,
know us or give themselves the trouble to make
our acquaintance, though we were born to occupy
a higher position in society than most of them.
But that does not disturb us; we quietly go our
way among them. Their ideas are certainly not
ours, for we look at the bright side of things and
only speak of what is good, although that is sometimes
difficult to find where none exists. Except
ourselves and the cock, there is not one in the
yard who can be called talented or polite. It cannot
be said even of the ducks, and we warn you,
little bird, not to trust that one yonder, with the
short tail feathers, for she is cunning. Then the
curiously marked one, with the crooked stripes on
her wings, is a mischief-maker and never lets any
one have the last word, though she is always in
the wrong. The fat duck yonder speaks evil of
every one, and that is against our principles; if
we have nothing good to tell, we close our beaks.
The Portuguese is the only one who has had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
any education and with whom we can associate,
but she is passionate and talks too much about
Portugal."</p>

<p>"I wonder what those two Chinese are whispering
about," whispered one duck to another.
"They are always doing it, and it annoys me.
We never speak to them."</p>

<p>Now the drake came up, and he thought the
little singing bird was a sparrow. "Well, I don't
understand the difference," he said; "it appears
to me all the same. He's only a plaything, and if
people will have playthings, why let them, I say."</p>

<p>"Don't take any notice of what he says," whispered
the Portuguese; "he is very well in matters
of business, and with him business is first. Now
I shall lie down and have a little rest. It is a duty
we owe to ourselves, so that we shall be nice and
fat when we come to be embalmed with sage and
onions and apples."</p>

<p>So she laid herself down in the sun and winked
with one eye. She had a very comfortable place
and felt so at ease that she fell asleep. The little
singing bird busied himself for some time with
his broken wing, and at last he too lay down,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
quite close to his protectress. The sun shone
warm and bright, and he found it a very good
place. But the fowls of the neighborhood were all
awake, and, to tell the truth, they had paid a visit
to the duck yard solely to find food for themselves.
The Chinese were the first to leave, and
the other fowls soon followed them.</p>

<p>The witty little duck said of the Portuguese
that "the old lady" was getting to be quite a
"doting ducky." All the other ducks laughed at
this. "'Doting ducky,'" they whispered; "oh,
that's too witty!" Then they repeated the joke
about "portulak" and declared it was most amusing.
After that they all lay down to have a
nap.</p>

<p>They had been lying asleep for quite a while,
when suddenly something was thrown into the
yard for them to eat. It came down with such a
bang that the whole company started up and
clapped their wings. The Portuguese awoke, too,
and rushed over to the other side of the yard. In
doing this she trod upon the little singing bird.</p>

<p>"Tweet," he cried; "you trod very hard upon
me, madam."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, then, why do you lie in my way?" she
retorted. "You must not be so touchy. I have
nerves of my own, but I do not cry 'Tweet.'"</p>

<p>"Don't be angry," said the little bird; "the
'Tweet' slipped out of my beak before I knew it."</p>

<p>The Portuguese did not listen to him, but began
eating as fast as she could, and made a good
meal. When she had finished she lay down again,
and the little bird, who wished to be amiable,
began to sing:</p>

<div class='poem'>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">"Chirp and twitter,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The dewdrops glitter,</span><br />
In the hours of sunny spring;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I'll sing my best,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Till I go to rest,</span><br />
With my head behind my wing."<br />
</div>

<p>"Now I want rest after my dinner," said the
Portuguese. "You must conform to the rules of
the place while you are here. I want to sleep now."</p>

<p>The little bird was quite taken aback, for he
meant it kindly. When madam awoke afterwards,
there he stood before her with a little corn he
had found, and laid it at her feet; but as she had
not slept well, she was naturally in a bad temper.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
"Give that to a chicken," she said, "and don't be
always standing in my way."</p>

<p>"Why are you angry with me?" replied the
little singing bird; "what have I done?"</p>

<p>"Done!" repeated the Portuguese duck; "your
mode of expressing yourself is not very polite. I
must call your attention to that fact."</p>

<p>"There was sunshine here yesterday," said the
little bird, "but to-day it is cloudy and the air is
heavy."</p>

<p>"You know very little about the weather, I
fancy," she retorted; "the day is not over yet.
Don't stand there looking so stupid."</p>

<p>"But you are looking at me just as the wicked
eyes looked when I fell into the yard yesterday."</p>

<p>"Impertinent creature!" exclaimed the Portuguese
duck. "Would you compare me with the
cat&mdash;that beast of prey? There's not a drop of
malicious blood in me. I've taken your part, and
now I'll teach you better manners." So saying,
she made a bite at the little singing-bird's head,
and he fell to the ground dead. "Now whatever
is the meaning of this?" she said. "Could he not
bear even such a little peck as I gave him?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
Then, certainly, he was not made for this world.
I've been like a mother to him, I know that, for
I've a good heart."</p>

<p>Then the cock from the neighboring yard stuck
his head in and crowed with steam-engine power.</p>

<p>"You'll kill me with your crowing," she cried.
"It's all your fault. He's lost his life, and I'm
very near losing mine."</p>

<p>"There's not much of him lying there," observed
the cock.</p>

<p>"Speak of him with respect," said the Portuguese
duck, "for he had manners and education,
and he could sing. He was affectionate and gentle,
and those are as rare qualities in animals as
in those who call themselves human beings."</p>

<p>Then all the ducks came crowding round the
little dead bird. Ducks have strong passions,
whether they feel envy or pity. There was nothing
to envy here, so they all showed a great deal
of pity. So also did the two Chinese. "We shall
never again have such a singing bird among us;
he was almost a Chinese," they whispered, and
then they wept with such a noisy, clucking sound
that all the other fowls clucked too. But the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
ducks went about with redder eyes afterwards.
"We have hearts of our own," they said; "nobody
can deny that."</p>

<p>"Hearts!" repeated the Portuguese. "Indeed
you have&mdash;almost as tender as the ducks in
Portugal."</p>

<p>"Let us think of getting something to satisfy
our hunger," said the drake; "that's the most important
business. If one of our toys is broken,
why, we have plenty more."</p>

<h2>THE SNOW MAN</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 51px;">
<img src="images/drop-iquote.png" width="51" height="100" alt="I" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'>T IS so delightfully cold that it makes my
whole body crackle," said the Snow Man.
"This is just the kind of wind to blow life
into one. How that great red thing up there is
staring at me!" He meant the sun, which was
just setting. "It shall not make me wink. I shall
manage to keep the pieces."</div>

<p>He had two triangular pieces of tile in his
head instead of eyes, and his mouth, being made
of an old broken rake, was therefore furnished
with teeth. He had been brought into existence
amid the joyous shouts of boys, the jingling of
sleigh bells, and the slashing of whips.</p>

<p>The sun went down, and the full moon rose,
large, round, and clear, shining in the deep blue.</p>

<p>"There it comes again, from the other side,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
said the Snow Man, who supposed the sun was
showing itself once more. "Ah, I have cured it
of staring. Now it may hang up there and shine,
so that I may see myself. If I only knew how
to manage to move away from this place&mdash;I
should so like to move! If I could, I would slide
along yonder on the ice, as I have seen the boys
do; but I don't understand how. I don't even
know how to run."</p>

<p>"Away, away!" barked the old yard dog. He
was quite hoarse and could not pronounce "Bow-wow"
properly. He had once been an indoor
dog and lain by the fire, and he had been hoarse
ever since. "The sun will make you run some
day. I saw it, last winter, make your predecessor
run, and his predecessor before him. Away,
away! They all have to go."</p>

<p>"I don't understand you, comrade," said the
Snow Man. "Is that thing up yonder to teach
me to run? I saw it running itself, a little while
ago, and now it has come creeping up from the
other side."</p>

<p>"You know nothing at all," replied the yard
dog. "But then, you've only lately been patched<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
up. What you see yonder is the moon, and what
you saw before was the sun. It will come again
to-morrow and most likely teach you to run
down into the ditch by the well, for I think the
weather is going to change. I can feel such pricks
and stabs in my left leg that I am sure there is
going to be a change."</p>

<p>"I don't understand him," said the Snow Man
to himself, "but I have a feeling that he is
talking of something very disagreeable. The
thing that stared so hard just now, which he
calls the sun, is not my friend; I can feel that
too."</p>

<p>"Away, away!" barked the yard dog, and then
he turned round three times and crept into his
kennel to sleep.</p>

<p>There really was a change in the weather.
Toward morning a thick fog covered the whole
country and a keen wind arose, so that the cold
seemed to freeze one's bones. But when the sun
rose, a splendid sight was to be seen. Trees and
bushes were covered with hoarfrost and looked
like a forest of white coral, while on every twig
glittered frozen dewdrops. The many delicate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
forms, concealed in summer by luxuriant foliage,
were now clearly defined and looked like glittering
lacework. A white radiance glistened from
every twig. The birches, waving in the wind,
looked as full of life as in summer and as wondrously
beautiful. Where the sun shone, everything
glittered and sparkled as if diamond dust
had been strewn about; and the snowy carpet
of the earth seemed covered with diamonds from
which gleamed countless lights, whiter even than
the snow itself.</p>

<p>"This is really beautiful," said a girl who
had come into the garden with a young friend;
and they both stood still near the Snow Man,
contemplating the glittering scene. "Summer
cannot show a more beautiful sight," she exclaimed,
while her eyes sparkled.</p>

<p>"And we can't have such a fellow as this in
the summer-time," replied the young man, pointing
to the Snow Man. "He is capital."</p>

<p>The girl laughed and nodded at the Snow
Man, then tripped away over the snow with her
friend. The snow creaked and crackled beneath
her feet, as if she had been treading on starch.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>"Who are those two?" asked the Snow Man
of the yard dog. "You have been here longer
than I; do you know them?"</p>

<p>"Of course I know them," replied the yard
dog; "the girl has stroked my back many times,
and the young man has often given me a bone
of meat. I never bite those two."</p>

<p>"But what are they?" asked the Snow Man.</p>

<p>"They are lovers," he replied. "They will go
and live in the same kennel, by and by, and gnaw
at the same bone. Away, away!"</p>

<p>"Are they the same kind of beings as you and
I?" asked the Snow Man.</p>

<p>"Well, they belong to the master," retorted
the yard dog. "Certainly people know very little
who were only born yesterday. I can see that in
you. I have age and experience. I know every
one here in the house, and I know there was
once a time when I did not lie out here in the
cold, fastened to a chain. Away, away!"</p>

<p>"The cold is delightful," said the Snow Man.
"But do tell me, tell me; only you must not
clank your chain so, for it jars within me when
you do that."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>"Away, away!" barked the yard dog. "I'll
tell you: they said I was a pretty little fellow,
once; then I used to lie in a velvet-covered chair,
up at the master's house, and sit in the mistress's
lap; they used to kiss my nose, and wipe my
paws with an embroidered handkerchief, and I
was called 'Ami, dear Ami, sweet Ami.' But
after a while I grew too big for them, and they
sent me away to the housekeeper's room; so I
came to live on the lower story. You can look
into the room from where you stand, and see
where I was once master&mdash;for I was, indeed,
master to the housekeeper. It was a much
smaller room than those upstairs, but I was more
comfortable, for I was not continually being taken
hold of and pulled about by the children, as I
had been. I received quite as good food and even
better. I had my own cushion, and there was a
stove&mdash;it is the finest thing in the world at this
season of the year. I used to go under the stove
and lie down. Ah, I still dream of that stove.
Away, away!"</p>

<p>"Does a stove look beautiful?" asked the
Snow Man. "Is it at all like me?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is just the opposite of you," said the dog.
"It's as black as a crow and has a long neck
and a brass knob; it eats firewood, and that
makes fire spurt out of its mouth. One has to
keep on one side or under it, to be comfortable.
You can see it through the window from where
you stand."</p>

<p>Then the Snow Man looked, and saw a bright
polished thing with a brass knob, and fire gleaming
from the lower part of it. The sight of this
gave the Snow Man a strange sensation; it was
very odd, he knew not what it meant, and he
could not account for it. But there are people
who are not men of snow who understand what
the feeling is. "And why did you leave her?"
asked the Snow Man, for it seemed to him
that the stove must be of the female sex. "How
could you give up such a comfortable place?"</p>

<p>"I was obliged to," replied the yard dog.
"They turned me out of doors and chained me
up here. I had bitten the youngest of my
master's sons in the leg, because he kicked
away the bone I was gnawing. 'Bone for bone,'
I thought. But they were very angry, and since<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
that time I have been fastened to a chain and
have lost my voice. Don't you hear how hoarse
I am? Away, away! I can't talk like other dogs
any more. Away, away! That was the end of
it all."</p>

<p>But the Snow Man was no longer listening.
He was looking into the housekeeper's room on
the lower story, where the stove, which was about
the same size as the Snow Man himself, stood on
its four iron legs. "What a strange crackling I
feel within me," he said. "Shall I ever get in
there? It is an innocent wish, and innocent
wishes are sure to be fulfilled. I must go in
there and lean against her, even if I have to
break the window."</p>

<p>"You must never go in there," said the yard
dog, "for if you approach the stove, you will melt
away, away."</p>

<p>"I might as well go," said the Snow Man, "for
I think I am breaking up as it is."</p>

<p>During the whole day the Snow Man stood
looking in through the window, and in the twilight
hour the room became still more inviting,
for from the stove came a gentle glow, not like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
the sun or the moon; it was only the kind of
radiance that can come from a stove when it has
been well fed. When the door of the stove was
opened, the flames darted out of its mouth,&mdash;as
is customary with all stoves,&mdash;and the light of
the flames fell with a ruddy gleam directly on the
face and breast of the Snow Man. "I can endure
it no longer," said he. "How beautiful it looks
when it stretches out its tongue!"</p>

<p>The night was long, but it did not appear so
to the Snow Man, who stood there enjoying his
own reflections and crackling with the cold. In
the morning the window-panes of the housekeeper's
room were covered with ice. They were
the most beautiful ice flowers any Snow Man
could desire, but they concealed the stove. These
window-panes would not thaw, and he could see
nothing of the stove, which he pictured to himself
as if it had been a beautiful human being.
The snow crackled and the wind whistled around
him; it was just the kind of frosty weather a
Snow Man ought to enjoy thoroughly. But he
did not enjoy it. How, indeed, could he enjoy
anything when he was so stove-sick?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>"That is a terrible disease for a Snow Man to
have," said the yard dog. "I have suffered from
it myself, but I got over it. Away, away!" he
barked, and then added, "The weather is going
to change."</p>

<p>The weather did change. It began to thaw,
and as the warmth increased, the Snow Man decreased.
He said nothing and made no complaint,
which is a sure sign.</p>

<p>One morning he broke and sank down altogether;
and behold! where he had stood, something
that looked like a broomstick remained
sticking up in the ground. It was the pole round
which the boys had built him.</p>

<p>"Ah, now I understand why he had such a
great longing for the stove," said the yard dog.
"Why, there's the shovel that is used for cleaning
out the stove, fastened to the pole. The Snow
Man had a stove scraper in his body; that was
what moved him so. But it is all over now.
Away, away!"</p>

<p>And soon the winter passed. "Away, away!"
barked the hoarse yard dog, but the girls in the
house sang:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<div class='poem'>
"Come from your fragrant home, green thyme;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Stretch your soft branches, willow tree;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The months are bringing the sweet spring-time,</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And I'll mock his note in my wanderings."</span><br />
</div>

<p>And nobody thought any more of the Snow
Man.</p>

<h2>THE FARMYARD COCK AND THE WEATHERCOCK</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 83px;">
<img src="images/drop-t.png" width="83" height="100" alt="T" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'>HERE were once two cocks; one of them
stood on a dunghill, the other on the roof.
Both were conceited, but the question is,
Which of the two was the more useful?</div>

<p>A wooden partition divided the poultry yard
from another yard, in which lay a heap of manure
sheltering a cucumber bed. In this bed grew a
large cucumber, which was fully aware that it
was a plant that should be reared in a hotbed.</p>

<p>"It is the privilege of birth," said the Cucumber
to itself. "All cannot be born cucumbers;
there must be other kinds as well. The fowls,
the ducks, and the cattle in the next yard are all
different creatures, and there is the yard cock&mdash;I
can look up to him when he is on the wooden<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
partition. He is certainly of much greater importance
than the weathercock, who is so highly
placed, and who can't even creak, much less crow&mdash;besides,
he has neither hens nor chickens, and
thinks only of himself, and perspires verdigris.
But the yard cock is something like a cock. His
gait is like a dance, and his crowing is music, and
wherever he goes it is instantly known. What a
trumpeter he is! If he would only come in here!
Even if he were to eat me up, stalk and all, it would
be a pleasant death." So said the Cucumber.</p>

<p>During the night the weather became very
bad; hens, chickens, and even the cock himself
sought shelter. The wind blew down with a crash
the partition between the two yards, and the tiles
came tumbling from the roof, but the weathercock
stood firm. He did not even turn round; in fact,
he could not, although he was fresh and newly
cast. He had been born full grown and did not
at all resemble the birds, such as the sparrows
and swallows, that fly beneath the vault of heaven.
He despised them and looked upon them as little
twittering birds that were made only to sing. The
pigeons, he admitted, were large and shone in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
sun like mother-of-pearl. They somewhat resembled
weathercocks, but were fat and stupid and
thought only of stuffing themselves with food.
"Besides," said the weathercock, "they are very
tiresome things to converse with."</p>

<p>The birds of passage often paid a visit to the
weathercock and told him tales of foreign lands,
of large flocks passing through the air, and of
encounters with robbers and birds of prey. These
were very interesting when heard for the first time,
but the weathercock knew the birds always repeated
themselves, and that made it tedious to listen.</p>

<p>"They are tedious, and so is every one else,"
said he; "there is no one fit to associate with.
One and all of them are wearisome and stupid.
The whole world is worth nothing&mdash;it is made
up of stupidity."</p>

<p>The weathercock was what is called "lofty,"
and that quality alone would have made him
interesting in the eyes of the Cucumber, had she
known it. But she had eyes only for the yard cock,
who had actually made his appearance in her
yard; for the violence of the storm had passed,
but the wind had blown down the wooden palings.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>"What do you think of that for crowing?" asked
the yard cock of his hens and chickens. It was
rather rough, and wanted elegance, but they did
not say so, as they stepped upon the dunghill
while the cock strutted about as if he had been a
knight. "Garden plant," he cried to the Cucumber.
She heard the words with deep feeling, for they
showed that he understood who she was, and she
forgot that he was pecking at her and eating her
up&mdash;a happy death!</p>

<p>Then the hens came running up, and the chickens
followed, for where one runs the rest run also.
They clucked and chirped and looked at the cock
and were proud that they belonged to him. "Cock-a-doodle-doo!"
crowed he; "the chickens in the
poultry yard will grow to be large fowls if I make
my voice heard in the world."</p>

<p>And the hens and chickens clucked and chirped,
and the cock told them a great piece of news.
"A cock can lay an egg," he said. "And what do
you think is in that egg? In that egg lies a
basilisk. No one can endure the sight of a basilisk.
Men know my power, and now you know what I
am capable of, also, and what a renowned bird<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
I am." And with this the yard cock flapped his
wings, erected his comb, and crowed again, till
all the hens and chickens trembled; but they
were proud that one of their race should be of
such renown in the world. They clucked and
they chirped so that the weathercock heard it;
he had heard it all, but had not stirred.</p>

<p>"It's all stupid stuff," said a voice within the
weathercock. "The yard cock does not lay eggs
any more than I do, and I am too lazy. I could
lay a wind egg if I liked, but the world is not
worth a wind egg. And now I don't intend to
sit here any longer."</p>

<p>With that, the weathercock broke off and fell
into the yard. He did not kill the yard cock,
although the hens said he intended to do so.</p>

<p>And what does the moral say? "Better to
crow than to be vainglorious and break down
at last."</p>

<img src="images/p112i.png" width="450" height="186" alt="THE RED SHOES" title="" />
</div>


<h2>THE RED SHOES</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 83px;">
<img src="images/drop-t.png" width="83" height="100" alt="T" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'>HERE was once a pretty, delicate little
girl, who was so poor that she had to
go barefoot in summer and wear coarse
wooden shoes in winter, which made her little
instep quite red.</div>

<p>In the center of the village there lived an old
shoemaker's wife. One day this good woman
made, as well as she could, a little pair of shoes
out of some strips of old red cloth. The shoes
were clumsy enough, to be sure, but they fitted
the little girl tolerably well, and anyway the
woman's intention was kind. The little girl's
name was Karen.</p>

<p>On the very day that Karen received the shoes,
her mother was to be buried. They were not at
all suitable for mourning, but she had no others,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
so she put them on her little bare feet and followed
the poor plain coffin to its last resting
place.</p>

<p>Just at that time a large, old-fashioned carriage
happened to pass by, and the old lady who sat in
it saw the little girl and pitied her.</p>

<p>"Give me the little girl," she said to the clergyman,
"and I will take care of her."</p>

<p>Karen supposed that all this happened because
of the red shoes, but the old lady thought them
frightful and ordered them to be burned. Karen
was then dressed in neat, well-fitting clothes and
taught to read and sew. People told her she was
pretty, but the mirror said, "You are much more
than pretty&mdash;you are beautiful."</p>

<p>It happened not long afterwards that the queen
and her little daughter, the princess, traveled
through the land. All the people, Karen among
the rest, flocked toward the palace and crowded
around it, while the little princess, dressed in
white, stood at the window for every one to see.
She wore neither a train nor a golden crown, but
on her feet were beautiful red morocco shoes,
which, it must be admitted, were prettier than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
those the shoemaker's wife had given to little
Karen. Surely nothing in the world could be
compared to those red shoes.</p>

<p>Now that Karen was old enough to be confirmed,
she of course had to have a new frock
and new shoes. The rich shoemaker in the town
took the measure of her little feet in his own
house, in a room where stood great glass cases
filled with all sorts of fine shoes and elegant,
shining boots. It was a pretty sight, but the old
lady could not see well and naturally did not
take so much pleasure in it as Karen. Among
the shoes were a pair of red ones, just like those
worn by the little princess. Oh, how gay they
were! The shoemaker said they had been made
for the child of a count, but had not fitted well.</p>

<p>"Are they of polished leather, that they shine
so?" asked the old lady.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, they do shine," replied Karen.
And since they fitted her, they were bought. But
the old lady had no idea that they were red, or
she would never in the world have allowed Karen
to go to confirmation in them, as she now did.
Every one, of course, looked at Karen's shoes;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
and when she walked up the nave to the chancel
it seemed to her that even the antique figures on
the monuments, the portraits of clergymen and
their wives, with their stiff ruffs and long black
robes, were fixing their eyes on her red shoes.
Even when the bishop laid his hand upon her
head and spoke of her covenant with God and
how she must now begin to be a full-grown
Christian, and when the organ pealed forth solemnly
and the children's fresh, sweet voices joined
with those of the choir&mdash;still Karen thought of
nothing but her shoes.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, when the old lady heard every
one speak of the red shoes, she said it was very
shocking and improper and that, in the future,
when Karen went to church it must always be
in black shoes, even if they were old.</p>

<p>The next Sunday was Karen's first Communion
day. She looked at her black shoes, and then at
her red ones, then again at the black and at the
red&mdash;and the red ones were put on.</p>

<p>The sun shone very brightly, and Karen and
the old lady walked to church through the cornfields,
for the road was very dusty.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>At the door of the church stood an old soldier,
who leaned upon a crutch and had a marvelously
long beard that was not white but red. He
bowed almost to the ground and asked the old
lady if he might dust her shoes. Karen, in her
turn, put out her little foot.</p>

<p>"Oh, look, what smart little dancing pumps!"
said the old soldier. "Mind you do not let them
slip off when you dance," and he passed his hands
over them. The old lady gave the soldier a half-penny
and went with Karen into the church.</p>

<p>As before, every one saw Karen's red shoes,
and all the carved figures too bent their gaze
upon them. When Karen knelt at the chancel
she thought only of the shoes; they floated before
her eyes, and she forgot to say her prayer
or sing her psalm.</p>

<p>At last all the people left the church, and the
old lady got into her carriage. As Karen lifted
her foot to step in, the old soldier said, "See what
pretty dancing shoes!" And Karen, in spite of
herself, made a few dancing steps. When she had
once begun, her feet went on of themselves; it was
as though the shoes had received power over her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
She danced round the church corner,&mdash;she could
not help it,&mdash;and the coachman had to run behind
and catch her to put her into the carriage.
Still her feet went on dancing, so, that she trod
upon the good lady's toes. It was not until the
shoes were taken from her feet that she had rest.</p>

<p>The shoes were put away in a closet, but Karen
could not resist going to look at them every now
and then.</p>

<p>Soon after this the old lady lay ill in bed, and
it was said that she could not recover. She had
to be nursed and waited on, and this, of course,
was no one's duty so much as it was Karen's, as
Karen herself well knew. But there happened to
be a great ball in the town, and Karen was invited.
She looked at the old lady, who was very ill, and
she looked at the red shoes. She put them on, for
she thought there could not be any sin in that,
and of course there was not&mdash;but she went next
to the ball and began to dance.</p>

<p>Strange to say, when she wanted to move to
the right the shoes bore her to the left; and
when she wished to dance up the room the shoes
persisted in going down the room. Down the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
stairs they carried her at last, into the street,
and out through the town gate. On and on she
danced, for dance she must, straight out into the
gloomy wood. Up among the trees something
glistened. She thought it was the round, red
moon, for she saw a face; but no, it was the old
soldier with the red beard, who sat and nodded,
saying, "See what pretty dancing shoes!"</p>

<p>She was dreadfully frightened and tried to
throw away the red shoes, but they clung fast
and she could not unclasp them. They seemed
to have grown fast to her feet. So dance she
must, and dance she did, over field and meadow,
in rain and in sunshine, by night and by day&mdash;and
by night it was by far more dreadful.</p>

<p>She danced out into the open churchyard,
but the dead there did not dance; they were at
rest and had much better things to do. She
would have liked to sit down on the poor man's
grave, where the bitter tansy grew, but for her
there was no rest.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 335px;">
<img src="images/p119i.png" width="335" height="500" alt="She danced past the open church door...." title="" />
</div>

<p>She danced past the open church door, and
there she saw an angel in long white robes and
with wings that reached from his shoulders to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
the earth. His look was stern and grave, and in
his hand he held a broad, glittering sword.</p>

<p>"Thou shalt dance," he said, "in thy red shoes,
till thou art pale and cold, and till thy body is
wasted like a skeleton. Thou shalt dance from
door to door, and wherever proud, haughty children
dwell thou shalt knock, that, hearing thee, they may
take warning. Dance thou shalt&mdash;dance on!"</p>

<p>"Mercy!" cried Karen; but she did not hear
the answer of the angel, for the shoes carried
her past the door and on into the fields.</p>

<p>One morning she danced past a well-known
door. Within was the sound of a psalm, and
presently a coffin strewn with flowers was borne
out. She knew that her friend, the old lady, was
dead, and in her heart she felt that she was
abandoned by all on earth and condemned by
God's angel in heaven.</p>

<p>Still on she danced&mdash;for she could not stop&mdash;through
thorns and briers, while her feet bled.
Finally, she danced to a lonely little house where
she knew that the executioner dwelt, and she
tapped at the window, saying, "Come out, come
out! I cannot come in, for I must dance."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>The man said, "Do you know who I am and
what I do?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Karen; "but do not strike off my
head, for then I could not live to repent of my
sin. Strike off my feet, that I may be rid of
my red shoes."</p>

<p>Then she confessed her sin, and the executioner
struck off the red shoes, which danced away over
the fields and into the deep wood. To Karen it
seemed that the feet had gone with the shoes, for
she had almost lost the power of walking.</p>

<p>"Now I have suffered enough for the red
shoes," she said; "I will go to the church, that
people may see me." But no sooner had she
hobbled to the church door than the shoes
danced before her and frightened her back.</p>

<p>All that week she endured the keenest sorrow
and shed many bitter tears. When Sunday came,
she said: "I am sure I must have suffered and
striven enough by this time. I am quite as good,
I dare say, as many who are holding their heads
high in the church." So she took courage and
went again. But before she reached the churchyard
gate the red shoes were dancing there, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
she turned back again in terror, more deeply
sorrowful than ever for her sin.</p>

<p>She then went to the pastor's house and begged
as a favor to be taken into the family's service,
promising to be diligent and faithful. She did
not want wages, she said, only a home with good
people. The clergyman's wife pitied her and
granted her request, and she proved industrious
and very thoughtful.</p>

<p>Earnestly she listened when at evening the
preacher read aloud the Holy Scriptures. All the
children came to love her, but when they spoke
of beauty and finery, she would shake her head
and turn away.</p>

<p>On Sunday, when they all went to church, they
asked her if she would not go, too, but she looked
sad and bade them go without her. Then she
went to her own little room, and as she sat with
the psalm book in her hand, reading its pages
with a gentle, pious mind, the wind brought to
her the notes of the organ. She raised her tearful
eyes and said, "O God, do thou help me!"</p>

<p>Then the sun shone brightly, and before her
stood the white angel that she had seen at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
church door. He no longer bore the glittering
sword, but in his hand was a beautiful branch of
roses. He touched the ceiling with it, and the
ceiling rose, and at each place where the branch
touched it there shone a star. He touched the
walls, and they widened so that Karen could see
the organ that was being played at the church.
She saw, too, the old pictures and statues on the
walls, and the congregation sitting in the seats
and singing psalms, for the church itself had come
to the poor girl in her narrow room, or she in her
chamber had come to it. She sat in the seat with
the rest of the clergyman's household, and when
the psalm was ended, they nodded and said,
"Thou didst well to come, Karen!"</p>

<p>"This is mercy," said she. "It is the grace
of God."</p>

<p>The organ pealed, and the chorus of children's
voices mingled sweetly with it. The bright sunshine
shed its warm light, through the windows,
over the pew in which Karen sat. Her heart was so
filled with sunshine, peace, and joy that it broke,
and her soul was borne by a sunbeam up to God,
where there was nobody to ask about the red shoes.</p>

<h2>THE LITTLE MERMAID</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 71px;">
<img src="images/drop-f.png" width="71" height="100" alt="F" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'>AR out in the ocean, where the water is as
blue as the prettiest cornflower and as clear
as crystal, it is very, very deep; so deep,
indeed, that no cable could sound it, and many
church steeples, piled one upon another, would
not reach from the ground beneath to the surface
of the water above. There dwell the Sea King
and his subjects.</div>

<p>We must not imagine that there is nothing at
the bottom of the sea but bare yellow sand. No,
indeed, for on this sand grow the strangest flowers
and plants, the leaves and stems of which are
so pliant that the slightest agitation of the water
causes them to stir as if they had life. Fishes,
both large and small, glide between the branches
as birds fly among the trees here upon land.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>In the deepest spot of all stands the castle of
the Sea King. Its walls are built of coral, and the
long Gothic windows are of the clearest amber.
The roof is formed of shells that open and close
as the water flows over them. Their appearance
is very beautiful, for in each lies a glittering pearl
which would be fit for the diadem of a queen.</p>

<p>The Sea King had been a widower for many
years, and his aged mother kept house for him.
She was a very sensible woman, but exceedingly
proud of her high birth, and on that account wore
twelve oysters on her tail, while others of high
rank were only allowed to wear six.</p>

<p>She was, however, deserving of very great praise,
especially for her care of the little sea princesses,
her six granddaughters. They were beautiful children,
but the youngest was the prettiest of them
all. Her skin was as clear and delicate as a rose
leaf, and her eyes as blue as the deepest sea; but,
like all the others, she had no feet and her body
ended in a fish's tail. All day long they played
in the great halls of the castle or among the living
flowers that grew out of the walls. The large
amber windows were open, and the fish swam in,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
just as the swallows fly into our houses when we
open the windows; only the fishes swam up to the
princesses, ate out of their hands, and allowed
themselves to be stroked.</p>

<p>Outside the castle there was a beautiful garden,
in which grew bright-red and dark-blue flowers,
and blossoms like flames of fire; the fruit glittered
like gold, and the leaves and stems waved
to and fro continually. The earth itself was the
finest sand, but blue as the flame of burning sulphur.
Over everything lay a peculiar blue radiance,
as if the blue sky were everywhere, above
and below, instead of the dark depths of the sea.
In calm weather the sun could be seen, looking
like a reddish-purple flower with light streaming
from the calyx.</p>

<p>Each of the young princesses had a little plot
of ground in the garden, where she might dig
and plant as she pleased. One arranged her flower
bed in the form of a whale; another preferred to
make hers like the figure of a little mermaid;
while the youngest child made hers round, like
the sun, and in it grew flowers as red as his
rays at sunset.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>She was a strange child, quiet and thoughtful.
While her sisters showed delight at the wonderful
things which they obtained from the wrecks of
vessels, she cared only for her pretty flowers, red
like the sun, and a beautiful marble statue. It
was the representation of a handsome boy, carved
out of pure white stone, which had fallen to the
bottom of the sea from a wreck.</p>

<p>She planted by the statue a rose-colored weeping
willow. It grew rapidly and soon hung its
fresh branches over the statue, almost down to
the blue sands. The shadows had the color of
violet and waved to and fro like the branches,
so that it seemed as if the crown of the tree and
the root were at play, trying to kiss each other.</p>

<p>Nothing gave her so much pleasure as to hear
about the world above the sea. She made her old
grandmother tell her all she knew of the ships
and of the towns, the people and the animals.
To her it seemed most wonderful and beautiful
to hear that the flowers of the land had fragrance,
while those below the sea had none; that the
trees of the forest were green; and that the
fishes among the trees could sing so sweetly that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
it was a pleasure to listen to them. Her grandmother
called the birds fishes, or the little mermaid
would not have understood what was meant,
for she had never seen birds.</p>

<p>"When you have reached your fifteenth year,"
said the grandmother, "you will have permission
to rise up out of the sea and sit on the rocks in
the moonlight, while the great ships go sailing
by. Then you will see both forests and towns."</p>

<p>In the following year, one of the sisters would
be fifteen, but as each was a year younger than
the other, the youngest would have to wait five
years before her turn came to rise up from the
bottom of the ocean to see the earth as we do.
However, each promised to tell the others what
she saw on her first visit and what she thought
was most beautiful. Their grandmother could
not tell them enough&mdash;there were so many
things about which they wanted to know.</p>

<p>None of them longed so much for her turn to
come as the youngest&mdash;she who had the longest
time to wait and who was so quiet and thoughtful.
Many nights she stood by the open window,
looking up through the dark blue water and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
watching the fish as they splashed about with
their fins and tails. She could see the moon and
stars shining faintly, but through the water they
looked larger than they do to our eyes. When
something like a black cloud passed between her
and them, she knew that it was either a whale
swimming over her head, or a ship full of human
beings who never imagined that a pretty little
mermaid was standing beneath them, holding out
her white hands towards the keel of their ship.</p>

<p>At length the eldest was fifteen and was allowed
to rise to the surface of the ocean.</p>

<p>When she returned she had hundreds of
things to talk about. But the finest thing, she
said, was to lie on a sand bank in the quiet moonlit
sea, near the shore, gazing at the lights of
the near-by town, that twinkled like hundreds of
stars, and listening to the sounds of music, the
noise of carriages, the voices of human beings,
and the merry pealing of the bells in the church
steeples. Because she could not go near all these
wonderful things, she longed for them all the more.</p>

<p>Oh, how eagerly did the youngest sister listen
to all these descriptions! And afterwards, when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
she stood at the open window looking up through
the dark-blue water, she thought of the great city,
with all its bustle and noise, and even fancied she
could hear the sound of the church bells down in
the depths of the sea.</p>

<p>In another year the second sister received permission
to rise to the surface of the water and
to swim about where she pleased. She rose just
as the sun was setting, and this, she said, was
the most beautiful sight of all. The whole sky
looked like gold, and violet and rose-colored
clouds, which she could not describe, drifted
across it. And more swiftly than the clouds, flew
a large flock of wild swans toward the setting
sun, like a long white veil across the sea. She
also swam towards the sun, but it sank into the
waves, and the rosy tints faded from the clouds
and from the sea.</p>

<p>The third sister's turn followed, and she was
the boldest of them all, for she swam up a broad
river that emptied into the sea. On the banks
she saw green hills covered with beautiful vines,
and palaces and castles peeping out from amid
the proud trees of the forest. She heard birds<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
singing and felt the rays of the sun so strongly
that she was obliged often to dive under the
water to cool her burning face. In a narrow
creek she found a large group of little human
children, almost naked, sporting about in the
water. She wanted to play with them, but they
fled in a great fright; and then a little black animal&mdash;it
was a dog, but she did not know it, for
she had never seen one before&mdash;came to the water
and barked at her so furiously that she became
frightened and rushed back to the open sea. But
she said she should never forget the beautiful
forest, the green hills, and the pretty children who
could swim in the water although they had no tails.</p>

<p>The fourth sister was more timid. She remained
in the midst of the sea, but said it was
quite as beautiful there as nearer the land. She
could see many miles around her, and the sky
above looked like a bell of glass. She had seen
the ships, but at such a great distance that they
looked like sea gulls. The dolphins sported in
the waves, and the great whales spouted water
from their nostrils till it seemed as if a hundred
fountains were playing in every direction.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>The fifth sister's birthday occurred in the winter,
so when her turn came she saw what the
others had not seen the first time they went up.
The sea looked quite green, and large icebergs
were floating about, each like a pearl, she said,
but larger and loftier than the churches built by
men. They were of the most singular shapes and
glittered like diamonds. She had seated herself
on one of the largest and let the wind play with
her long hair. She noticed that all the ships sailed
past very rapidly, steering as far away as they
could, as if they were afraid of the iceberg.
Towards evening, as the sun went down, dark
clouds covered the sky, the thunder rolled, and
the flashes of lightning glowed red on the icebergs
as they were tossed about by the heaving sea. On
all the ships the sails were reefed with fear and
trembling, while she sat on the floating iceberg,
calmly watching the lightning as it darted its
forked flashes into the sea.</p>

<p>Each of the sisters, when first she had permission
to rise to the surface, was delighted with the
new and beautiful sights. Now that they were
grown-up girls and could go when they pleased,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
they had become quite indifferent about it. They
soon wished themselves back again, and after a
month had passed they said it was much more
beautiful down below and pleasanter to be at
home.</p>

<p>Yet often, in the evening hours, the five sisters
would twine their arms about each other and rise
to the surface together. Their voices were more
charming than that of any human being, and before
the approach of a storm, when they feared
that a ship might be lost, they swam before the
vessel, singing enchanting songs of the delights
to be found in the depths of the sea and begging
the voyagers not to fear if they sank to the bottom.
But the sailors could not understand the song
and thought it was the sighing of the storm.
These things were never beautiful to them, for
if the ship sank, the men were drowned and
their dead bodies alone reached the palace of
the Sea King.</p>

<p>When the sisters rose, arm in arm, through the
water, their youngest sister would stand quite
alone, looking after them, ready to cry&mdash;only, since
mermaids have no tears, she suffered more acutely.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, were I but fifteen years old!" said she.
"I know that I shall love the world up there,
and all the people who live in it."</p>

<p>At last she reached her fifteenth year.</p>

<p>"Well, now you are grown up," said the old
dowager, her grandmother. "Come, and let me
adorn you like your sisters." And she placed
in her hair a wreath of white lilies, of which
every flower leaf was half a pearl. Then the old
lady ordered eight great oysters to attach themselves
to the tail of the princess to show her
high rank.</p>

<p>"But they hurt me so," said the little mermaid.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know; pride must suffer pain," replied
the old lady.</p>

<p>Oh, how gladly she would have shaken off all
this grandeur and laid aside the heavy wreath!
The red flowers in her own garden would have
suited her much better. But she could not change
herself, so she said farewell and rose as lightly
as a bubble to the surface of the water.</p>

<p>The sun had just set when she raised her head
above the waves. The clouds were tinted with
crimson and gold, and through the glimmering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
twilight beamed the evening star in all its beauty.
The sea was calm, and the air mild and fresh. A
large ship with three masts lay becalmed on the
water; only one sail was set, for not a breeze
stirred, and the sailors sat idle on deck or amidst
the rigging. There was music and song on board,
and as darkness came on, a hundred colored lanterns
were lighted, as if the flags of all nations
waved in the air.</p>

<p>The little mermaid swam close to the cabin
windows, and now and then, as the waves lifted
her up, she could look in through glass window-panes
and see a number of gayly dressed people.</p>

<p>Among them, and the most beautiful of all,
was a young prince with large, black eyes. He
was sixteen years of age, and his birthday was
being celebrated with great display. The sailors
were dancing on deck, and when the prince came
out of the cabin, more than a hundred rockets
rose in the air, making it as bright as day. The
little mermaid was so startled that she dived under
water, and when she again stretched out her
head, it looked as if all the stars of heaven were
falling around her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>She had never seen such fireworks before. Great
suns spurted fire about, splendid fireflies flew
into the blue air, and everything was reflected in
the clear, calm sea beneath. The ship itself was
so brightly illuminated that all the people, and
even the smallest rope, could be distinctly seen.
How handsome the young prince looked, as he
pressed the hands of all his guests and smiled at
them, while the music resounded through the
clear night air!</p>

<p>It was very late, yet the little mermaid could
not take her eyes from the ship or from the beautiful
prince. The colored lanterns had been extinguished,
no more rockets rose in the air, and the
cannon had ceased firing; but the sea became
restless, and a moaning, grumbling sound could
be heard beneath the waves. Still the little mermaid
remained by the cabin window, rocking up
and down on the water, so that she could look
within. After a while the sails were quickly set,
and the ship went on her way. But soon the
waves rose higher, heavy clouds darkened the sky,
and lightning appeared in the distance. A dreadful
storm was approaching. Once more the sails<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
were furled, and the great ship pursued her flying
course over the raging sea. The waves rose mountain
high, as if they would overtop the mast, but
the ship dived like a swan between them, then
rose again on their lofty, foaming crests. To the
little mermaid this was pleasant sport; but not so
to the sailors. At length the ship groaned and
creaked; the thick planks gave way under the
lashing of the sea, as the waves broke over the
deck; the mainmast snapped asunder like a reed,
and as the ship lay over on her side, the water
rushed in.</p>

<p>The little mermaid now perceived that the crew
were in danger; even she was obliged to be careful,
to avoid the beams and planks of the wreck
which lay scattered on the water. At one moment
it was pitch dark so that she could not see a
single object, but when a flash of lightning came
it revealed the whole scene; she could see every
one who had been on board except the prince.
When the ship parted, she had seen him sink into
the deep waves, and she was glad, for she thought
he would now be with her. Then she remembered
that human beings could not live in the water, so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
that when he got down to her father's palace he
would certainly be quite dead.</p>

<p>No, he must not die! So she swam about
among the beams and planks which strewed the
surface of the sea, forgetting that they could crush
her to pieces. Diving deep under the dark waters,
rising and falling with the waves, she at length
managed to reach the young prince, who was fast
losing the power to swim in that stormy sea. His
limbs were failing him, his beautiful eyes were
closed, and he would have died had not the little
mermaid come to his assistance. She held his
head above the water and let the waves carry
them where they would.</p>

<p>In the morning the storm had ceased, but of
the ship not a single fragment could be seen.
The sun came up red and shining out of the
water, and its beams brought back the hue of
health to the prince's cheeks, but his eyes remained
closed. The mermaid kissed his high,
smooth forehead and stroked back his wet hair.
He seemed to her like the marble statue in her
little garden, so she kissed him again and wished
that he might live.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>Presently they came in sight of land, and she
saw lofty blue mountains on which the white
snow rested as if a flock of swans were lying upon
them. Beautiful green forests were near the shore,
and close by stood a large building, whether a
church or a convent she could not tell. Orange
and citron trees grew in the garden, and before
the door stood lofty palms. The sea here formed
a little bay, in which the water lay quiet and still,
but very deep. She swam with the handsome
prince to the beach, which was covered with fine
white sand, and there she laid him in the warm
sunshine, taking care to raise his head higher than
his body. Then bells sounded in the large white
building, and some young girls came into the
garden. The little mermaid swam out farther
from the shore and hid herself among some
high rocks that rose out of the water. Covering
her head and neck with the foam of the sea, she
watched there to see what would become of the
poor prince.</p>

<p>It was not long before she saw a young girl approach
the spot where the prince lay. She seemed
frightened at first, but only for a moment; then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
she brought a number of people, and the mermaid
saw that the prince came to life again and smiled
upon those who stood about him. But to her he
sent no smile; he knew not that she had saved
him. This made her very sorrowful, and when he
was led away into the great building, she dived
down into the water and returned to her father's
castle.</p>

<p>She had always been silent and thoughtful, and
now she was more so than ever. Her sisters
asked her what she had seen during her first visit
to the surface of the water, but she could tell
them nothing. Many an evening and morning
did she rise to the place where she had left the
prince. She saw the fruits in the garden ripen
and watched them gathered; she watched the
snow on the mountain tops melt away; but never
did she see the prince, and therefore she always
returned home more sorrowful than before.</p>

<p>It was her only comfort to sit in her own little
garden and fling her arm around the beautiful
marble statue, which was like the prince. She
gave up tending her flowers, and they grew in
wild confusion over the paths, twining their long<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
leaves and stems round the branches of the trees
so that the whole place became dark and gloomy.</p>

<p>At length she could bear it no longer and told
one of her sisters all about it. Then the others
heard the secret, and very soon it became known
to several mermaids, one of whom had an intimate
friend who happened to know about the
prince. She had also seen the festival on board
ship, and she told them where the prince came
from and where his palace stood.</p>

<p>"Come, little sister," said the other princesses.
Then they entwined their arms and rose together
to the surface of the water, near the spot where
they knew the prince's palace stood. It was built
of bright-yellow, shining stone and had long
flights of marble steps, one of which reached
quite down to the sea. Splendid gilded cupolas
rose over the roof, and between the pillars that
surrounded the whole building stood lifelike statues
of marble. Through the clear crystal of the
lofty windows could be seen noble rooms, with
costly silk curtains and hangings of tapestry and
walls covered with beautiful paintings. In the
center of the largest salon a fountain threw its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
sparkling jets high up into the glass cupola of
the ceiling, through which the sun shone in
upon the water and upon the beautiful plants
that grew in the basin of the fountain.</p>

<p>Now that the little mermaid knew where the
prince lived, she spent many an evening and
many a night on the water near the palace. She
would swim much nearer the shore than any of
the others had ventured, and once she went up
the narrow channel under the marble balcony,
which threw a broad shadow on the water. Here
she sat and watched the young prince, who
thought himself alone in the bright moonlight.</p>

<p>She often saw him evenings, sailing in a beautiful
boat on which music sounded and flags
waved. She peeped out from among the green
rushes, and if the wind caught her long silvery-white
veil, those who saw it believed it to be a
swan, spreading out its wings.</p>

<p>Many a night, too, when the fishermen set
their nets by the light of their torches, she heard
them relate many good things about the young
prince. And this made her glad that she had
saved his life when he was tossed about half dead<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
on the waves. She remembered how his head
had rested on her bosom and how heartily she
had kissed him, but he knew nothing of all this
and could not even dream of her.</p>

<p>She grew more and more to like human beings
and wished more and more to be able to wander
about with those whose world seemed to be so
much larger than her own. They could fly over
the sea in ships and mount the high hills which
were far above the clouds; and the lands they
possessed, their woods and their fields, stretched
far away beyond the reach of her sight. There
was so much that she wished to know! but her
sisters were unable to answer all her questions.
She then went to her old grandmother, who
knew all about the upper world, which she
rightly called "the lands above the sea."</p>

<p>"If human beings are not drowned," asked
the little mermaid, "can they live forever? Do
they never die, as we do here in the sea?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the old lady, "they must also
die, and their term of life is even shorter than
ours. We sometimes live for three hundred
years, but when we cease to exist here, we become<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
only foam on the surface of the water and have
not even a grave among those we love. We
have not immortal souls, we shall never live
again; like the green seaweed when once it has
been cut off, we can never flourish more. Human
beings, on the contrary, have souls which live forever,
even after the body has been turned to dust.
They rise up through the clear, pure air, beyond
the glittering stars. As we rise out of the water
and behold all the land of the earth, so do they
rise to unknown and glorious regions which we
shall never see."</p>

<p>"Why have not we immortal souls?" asked the
little mermaid, mournfully. "I would gladly give
all the hundreds of years that I have to live, to be
a human being only for one day and to have the
hope of knowing the happiness of that glorious
world above the stars."</p>

<p>"You must not think that," said the old woman.
"We believe that we are much happier and much
better off than human beings."</p>

<p>"So I shall die," said the little mermaid, "and
as the foam of the sea I shall be driven about,
never again to hear the music of the waves or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
to see the pretty flowers or the red sun? Is there
anything I can do to win an immortal soul?"</p>

<p>"No," said the old woman; "unless a man should
love you so much that you were more to him
than his father or his mother, and if all his
thoughts and all his love were fixed upon you,
and the priest placed his right hand in yours, and
he promised to be true to you here and hereafter&mdash;then
his soul would glide into your body, and
you would obtain a share in the future happiness
of mankind. He would give to you a soul and
retain his own as well; but this can never happen.
Your fish's tail, which among us is considered so
beautiful, on earth is thought to be quite ugly.
They do not know any better, and they think it
necessary, in order to be handsome, to have two
stout props, which they call legs."</p>

<p>Then the little mermaid sighed and looked
sorrowfully at her fish's tail. "Let us be happy,"
said the old lady, "and dart and spring about
during the three hundred years that we have to
live, which is really quite long enough. After
that we can rest ourselves all the better. This
evening we are going to have a court ball."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>It was one of those splendid sights which we
can never see on earth. The walls and the ceiling
of the large ballroom were of thick but transparent
crystal. Many hundreds of colossal shells,&mdash;some
of a deep red, others of a grass green,&mdash;with blue
fire in them, stood in rows on each side. These
lighted up the whole salon, and shone through
the walls so that the sea was also illuminated.
Innumerable fishes, great and small, swam past
the crystal walls; on some of them the scales
glowed with a purple brilliance, and on others
shone like silver and gold. Through the halls
flowed a broad stream, and in it danced the mermen
and the mermaids to the music of their own
sweet singing.</p>

<p>No one on earth has such lovely voices as they,
but the little mermaid sang more sweetly than all.
The whole court applauded her with hands and
tails, and for a moment her heart felt quite gay,
for she knew she had the sweetest voice either
on earth or in the sea. But soon she thought
again of the world above her; she could not
forget the charming prince, nor her sorrow that
she had not an immortal soul like his. She crept<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
away silently out of her father's palace, and while
everything within was gladness and song, she
sat in her own little garden, sorrowful and alone.
Then she heard the bugle sounding through the
water and thought: "He is certainly sailing
above, he in whom my wishes center and in
whose hands I should like to place the happiness
of my life. I will venture all for him and to win
an immortal soul. While my sisters are dancing
in my father's palace I will go to the sea witch,
of whom I have always been so much afraid;
she can give me counsel and help."</p>

<p>Then the little mermaid went out from her
garden and took the road to the foaming whirlpools,
behind which the sorceress lived. She had
never been that way before. Neither flowers nor
grass grew there; nothing but bare, gray, sandy
ground stretched out to the whirlpool, where the
water, like foaming mill wheels, seized everything
that came within its reach and cast it into the
fathomless deep. Through the midst of these
crushing whirlpools the little mermaid was obliged
to pass before she could reach the dominions of the
sea witch. Then, for a long distance, the road lay<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
across a stretch of warm, bubbling mire, called
by the witch her turf moor.</p>

<p>Beyond this was the witch's house, which stood
in the center of a strange forest, where all the
trees and flowers were polypi, half animals and
half plants. They looked like serpents with a
hundred heads, growing out of the ground. The
branches were long, slimy arms, with fingers like
flexible worms, moving limb after limb from the
root to the top. All that could be reached in the
sea they seized upon and held fast, so that it
never escaped from their clutches.</p>

<p>The little mermaid was so alarmed at what she
saw that she stood still and her heart beat with
fear. She came very near turning back, but she
thought of the prince and of the human soul for
which she longed, and her courage returned. She
fastened her long, flowing hair round her head, so
that the polypi should not lay hold of it. She
crossed her hands on her bosom, and then darted
forward as a fish shoots through the water, between
the supple arms and fingers of the ugly
polypi, which were stretched out on each side of
her. She saw that they all held in their grasp<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
something they had seized with their numerous
little arms, which were as strong as iron bands.
Tightly grasped in their clinging arms were white
skeletons of human beings who had perished at sea
and had sunk down into the deep waters; skeletons
of land animals; and oars, rudders, and chests,
of ships. There was even a little mermaid whom
they had caught and strangled, and this seemed
the most shocking of all to the little princess.</p>

<p>She now came to a space of marshy ground in
the wood, where large, fat water snakes were rolling
in the mire and showing their ugly, drab-colored
bodies. In the midst of this spot stood a
house, built of the bones of shipwrecked human
beings. There sat the sea witch, allowing a toad
to eat from her mouth just as people sometimes
feed a canary with pieces of sugar. She called the
ugly water snakes her little chickens and allowed
them to crawl all over her bosom.</p>

<p>"I know what you want," said the sea witch.
"It is very stupid of you, but you shall have your
way, though it will bring you to sorrow, my pretty
princess. You want to get rid of your fish's tail
and to have two supports instead, like human<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
beings on earth, so that the young prince may fall
in love with you and so that you may have an
immortal soul." And then the witch laughed so
loud and so disgustingly that the toad and the
snakes fell to the ground and lay there wriggling.</p>

<p>"You are but just in time," said the witch,
"for after sunrise to-morrow I should not be able
to help you till the end of another year. I will
prepare a draft for you, with which you must
swim to land to-morrow before sunrise; seat
yourself there and drink it. Your tail will then
disappear, and shrink up into what men call legs.</p>

<p>"You will feel great pain, as if a sword were
passing through you. But all who see you will
say that you are the prettiest little human being
they ever saw. You will still have the same floating
gracefulness of movement, and no dancer will
ever tread so lightly. Every step you take, however,
will be as if you were treading upon sharp
knives and as if the blood must flow. If you will
bear all this, I will help you."</p>

<p>"Yes, I will," said the little princess in a trembling
voice, as she thought of the prince and the
immortal soul.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>"But think again," said the witch, "for when
once your shape has become like a human being,
you can no more be a mermaid. You will never
return through the water to your sisters or to
your father's palace again. And if you do not win
the love of the prince, so that he is willing to forget
his father and mother for your sake and to
love you with his whole soul and allow the priest
to join your hands that you may be man and wife,
then you will never have an immortal soul. The
first morning after he marries another, your heart
will break and you will become foam on the crest
of the waves."</p>

<p>"I will do it," said the little mermaid, and she
became pale as death.</p>

<p>"But I must be paid, also," said the witch,
"and it is not a trifle that I ask. You have the
sweetest voice of any who dwell here in the depths
of the sea, and you believe that you will be able
to charm the prince with it. But this voice you
must give to me. The best thing you possess will
I have as the price of my costly draft, which
must be mixed with my own blood so that it may
be as sharp as a two-edged sword."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>"But if you take away my voice," said the little
mermaid, "what is left for me?"</p>

<p>"Your beautiful form, your graceful walk, and
your expressive eyes. Surely with these you can
enchain a man's heart. Well, have you lost your
courage? Put out your little tongue, that I may
cut it off as my payment; then you shall have
the powerful draft."</p>

<p>"It shall be," said the little mermaid.</p>

<p>Then the witch placed her caldron on the fire,
to prepare the magic draft.</p>

<p>"Cleanliness is a good thing," said she, scouring
the vessel with snakes which she had tied
together in a large knot. Then she pricked herself
in the breast and let the black blood drop
into the caldron. The steam that rose twisted
itself into such horrible shapes that no one could
look at them without fear. Every moment the
witch threw a new ingredient into the vessel, and
when it began to boil, the sound was like the
weeping of a crocodile. When at last the magic
draft was ready, it looked like the clearest water.</p>

<p>"There it is for you," said the witch. Then she
cut off the mermaid's tongue, so that she would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
never again speak or sing. "If the polypi should
seize you as you return through the wood," said
the witch, "throw over them a few drops of the
potion, and their fingers will be torn into a thousand
pieces." But the little mermaid had no occasion
to do this, for the polypi sprang back in terror
when they caught sight of the glittering draft,
which shone in her hand like a twinkling star.</p>

<p>So she passed quickly through the wood and
the marsh and between the rushing whirlpools.
She saw that in her father's palace the torches in
the ballroom were extinguished and that all within
were asleep. But she did not venture to go in to
them, for now that she was dumb and going to
leave them forever she felt as if her heart would
break. She stole into the garden, took a flower
from the flower bed of each of her sisters, kissed
her hand towards the palace a thousand times, and
then rose up through the dark-blue waters.</p>

<p>The sun had not risen when she came in sight
of the prince's palace and approached the beautiful
marble steps, but the moon shone clear and
bright. Then the little mermaid drank the magic
draft, and it seemed as if a two-edged sword<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
went through her delicate body. She fell into a
swoon and lay like one dead. When the sun rose
and shone over the sea, she recovered and felt a
sharp pain, but before her stood the handsome
young prince.</p>

<p>He fixed his coal-black eyes upon her so earnestly
that she cast down her own and then became
aware that her fish's tail was gone and that
she had as pretty a pair of white legs and tiny
feet as any little maiden could have. But she had
no clothes, so she wrapped herself in her long,
thick hair. The prince asked her who she was
and whence she came. She looked at him mildly
and sorrowfully with her deep blue eyes, but
could not speak. He took her by the hand and
led her to the palace.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 336px;">
<img src="images/p155i.png" width="336" height="500" alt="Before her stood the handsome young prince...." title="" />
</div>

<p>Every step she took was as the witch had said
it would be; she felt as if she were treading upon
the points of needles or sharp knives. She bore
it willingly, however, and moved at the prince's
side as lightly as a bubble, so that he and all who
saw her wondered at her graceful, swaying movements.
She was very soon arrayed in costly robes
of silk and muslin and was the most beautiful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
creature in the palace; but she was dumb and
could neither speak nor sing.</p>

<p>Beautiful female slaves, dressed in silk and gold,
stepped forward and sang before the prince and
his royal parents. One sang better than all the
others, and the prince clapped his hands and
smiled at her. This was a great sorrow to the
little mermaid, for she knew how much more
sweetly she herself once could sing, and she
thought, "Oh, if he could only know that I have
given away my voice forever, to be with him!"</p>

<p>The slaves next performed some pretty fairy-like
dances, to the sound of beautiful music. Then
the little mermaid raised her lovely white arms,
stood on the tips of her toes, glided over the
floor, and danced as no one yet had been able to
dance. At each moment her beauty was more
revealed, and her expressive eyes appealed more
directly to the heart than the songs of the slaves.
Every one was enchanted, especially the prince,
who called her his little foundling. She danced
again quite readily, to please him, though each
time her foot touched the floor it seemed as if she
trod on sharp knives.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>The prince said she should remain with him
always, and she was given permission to sleep at
his door, on a velvet cushion. He had a page's
dress made for her, that she might accompany
him on horseback. They rode together through
the sweet-scented woods, where the green boughs
touched their shoulders, and the little birds sang
among the fresh leaves. She climbed with him to
the tops of high mountains, and although her
tender feet bled so that even her steps were
marked, she only smiled, and followed him till
they could see the clouds beneath them like a
flock of birds flying to distant lands. While at the
prince's palace, and when all the household were
asleep, she would go and sit on the broad marble
steps, for it eased her burning feet to bathe
them in the cold sea water. It was then that she
thought of all those below in the deep.</p>

<p>Once during the night her sisters came up arm
in arm, singing sorrowfully as they floated on
the water. She beckoned to them, and they recognized
her and told her how she had grieved
them; after that, they came to the same place
every night. Once she saw in the distance her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
old grandmother, who had not been to the surface
of the sea for many years, and the old Sea
King, her father, with his crown on his head.
They stretched out their hands towards her, but
did not venture so near the land as her sisters had.</p>

<p>As the days passed she loved the prince more
dearly, and he loved her as one would love a little
child. The thought never came to him to make
her his wife. Yet unless he married her, she
could not receive an immortal soul, and on the
morning after his marriage with another, she
would dissolve into the foam of the sea.</p>

<p>"Do you not love me the best of them all?"
the eyes of the little mermaid seemed to say
when he took her in his arms and kissed her
fair forehead.</p>

<p>"Yes, you are dear to me," said the prince,
"for you have the best heart and you are the
most devoted to me. You are like a young
maiden whom I once saw, but whom I shall
never meet again. I was in a ship that was
wrecked, and the waves cast me ashore near a
holy temple where several young maidens performed
the service. The youngest of them found<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
me on the shore and saved my life. I saw her
but twice, and she is the only one in the world
whom I could love. But you are like her, and
you have almost driven her image from my mind.
She belongs to the holy temple, and good fortune
has sent you to me in her stead. We will never
part.</p>

<p>"Ah, he knows not that it was I who saved his
life," thought the little mermaid. "I carried him
over the sea to the wood where the temple stands;
I sat beneath the foam and watched till the
human beings came to help him. I saw the
pretty maiden that he loves better than he loves
me." The mermaid sighed deeply, but she could
not weep. "He says the maiden belongs to the
holy temple, therefore she will never return to
the world&mdash;they will meet no more. I am by
his side and see him every day. I will take
care of him, and love him, and give up my life
for his sake."</p>

<p>Very soon it was said that the prince was to
marry and that the beautiful daughter of a
neighboring king would be his wife, for a fine
ship was being fitted out. Although the prince<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
gave out that he intended merely to pay a visit
to the king, it was generally supposed that he
went to court the princess. A great company
were to go with him. The little mermaid smiled
and shook her head. She knew the prince's
thoughts better than any of the others.</p>

<p>"I must travel," he had said to her; "I must
see this beautiful princess. My parents desire it,
but they will not oblige me to bring her home as
my bride. I cannot love her, because she is not
like the beautiful maiden in the temple, whom
you resemble. If I were forced to choose a bride,
I would choose you, my dumb foundling, with
those expressive eyes." Then he kissed her rosy
mouth, played with her long, waving hair, and
laid his head on her heart, while she dreamed of
human happiness and an immortal soul.</p>

<p>"You are not afraid of the sea, my dumb child,
are you?" he said, as they stood on the deck of
the noble ship which was to carry them to the
country of the neighboring king. Then he told
her of storm and of calm, of strange fishes in the
deep beneath them, and of what the divers had
seen there. She smiled at his descriptions, for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
she knew better than any one what wonders were
at the bottom of the sea.</p>

<p>In the moonlight night, when all on board were
asleep except the man at the helm, she sat on
deck, gazing down through the clear water. She
thought she could distinguish her father's castle,
and upon it her aged grandmother, with the
silver crown on her head, looking through the
rushing tide at the keel of the vessel. Then her
sisters came up on the waves and gazed at her
mournfully, wringing their white hands. She
beckoned to them, and smiled, and wanted to
tell them how happy and well off she was. But
the cabin boy approached, and when her sisters
dived down, he thought what he saw was only
the foam of the sea.</p>

<p>The next morning the ship sailed into the harbor
of a beautiful town belonging to the king
whom the prince was going to visit. The church
bells were ringing, and from the high towers
sounded a flourish of trumpets. Soldiers, with
flying colors and glittering bayonets, lined the
roads through which they passed. Every day
was a festival, balls and entertainments following<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
one another. But the princess had not yet appeared.
People said that she had been brought
up and educated in a religious house, where she
was learning every royal virtue.</p>

<p>At last she came. Then the little mermaid,
who was anxious to see whether she was really
beautiful, was obliged to admit that she had
never seen a more perfect vision of beauty. Her
skin was delicately fair, and beneath her long,
dark eyelashes her laughing blue eyes shone
with truth and purity.</p>

<p>"It was you," said the prince, "who saved my
life when I lay as if dead on the beach," and
he folded his blushing bride in his arms.</p>

<p>"Oh, I am too happy!" said he to the little
mermaid; "my fondest hopes are now fulfilled.
You will rejoice at my happiness, for your
devotion to me is great and sincere."</p>

<p>The little mermaid kissed his hand and felt
as if her heart were already broken. His wedding
morning would bring death to her, and
she would change into the foam of the sea.</p>

<p>All the church bells rang, and the heralds
rode through the town proclaiming the betrothal.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
Perfumed oil was burned in costly silver lamps
on every altar. The priests waved the censers,
while the bride and the bridegroom joined their
hands and received the blessing of the bishop.
The little mermaid, dressed in silk and gold,
held up the bride's train; but her ears heard
nothing of the festive music, and her eyes saw
not the holy ceremony. She thought of the night
of death which was coming to her, and of all she
had lost in the world.</p>

<p>On the same evening the bride and bridegroom
went on board the ship. Cannons were
roaring, flags waving, and in the center of the
ship a costly tent of purple and gold had been
erected. It contained elegant sleeping couches
for the bridal pair during the night. The ship,
under a favorable wind, with swelling sails, glided
away smoothly and lightly over the calm sea.</p>

<p>When it grew dark, a number of colored lamps
were lighted and the sailors danced merrily on
the deck. The little mermaid could not help
thinking of her first rising out of the sea, when
she had seen similar joyful festivities, so she too
joined in the dance, poised herself in the air<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
as a swallow when he pursues his prey, and all
present cheered her wonderingly. She had never
danced so gracefully before. Her tender feet felt
as if cut with sharp knives, but she cared not for
the pain; a sharper pang had pierced her heart.</p>

<p>She knew this was the last evening she should
ever see the prince for whom she had forsaken
her kindred and her home. She had given up
her beautiful voice and suffered unheard-of pain
daily for him, while he knew nothing of it. This
was the last evening that she should breathe the
same air with him or gaze on the starry sky and
the deep sea. An eternal night, without a thought
or a dream, awaited her. She had no soul, and
now could never win one.</p>

<p>All was joy and gaiety on the ship until long
after midnight. She smiled and danced with
the rest, while the thought of death was in her
heart. The prince kissed his beautiful bride and
she played with his raven hair till they went arm
in arm to rest in the sumptuous tent. Then all
became still on board the ship, and only the
pilot, who stood at the helm, was awake. The
little mermaid leaned her white arms on the edge<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
of the vessel and looked towards the east for the
first blush of morning&mdash;for that first ray of the
dawn which was to be her death. She saw her
sisters rising out of the flood. They were as pale
as she, but their beautiful hair no longer waved
in the wind; it had been cut off.</p>

<p>"We have given our hair to the witch," said
they, "to obtain help for you, that you may not
die to-night. She has given us a knife; see, it is
very sharp. Before the sun rises you must plunge
it into the heart of the prince. When the warm
blood falls upon your feet they will grow together
again into a fish's tail, and you will once more be
a mermaid and can return to us to live out your
three hundred years before you are changed into
the salt sea foam. Haste, then; either he or you
must die before sunrise. Our old grandmother
mourns so for you that her white hair is falling,
as ours fell under the witch's scissors. Kill the
prince, and come back. Hasten! Do you not see
the first red streaks in the sky? In a few
minutes the sun will rise, and you must die."</p>

<p>Then they sighed deeply and mournfully, and
sank beneath the waves.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>The little mermaid drew back the crimson
curtain of the tent and beheld the fair bride,
whose head was resting on the prince's breast.
She bent down and kissed his noble brow, then
looked at the sky, on which the rosy dawn grew
brighter and brighter. She glanced at the sharp
knife and again fixed her eyes on the prince,
who whispered the name of his bride in his
dreams.</p>

<p><i>She</i> was in his thoughts, and the knife trembled
in the hand of the little mermaid&mdash;but she
flung it far from her into the waves. The water
turned red where it fell, and the drops that
spurted up looked like blood. She cast one more
lingering, half-fainting glance at the prince, then
threw herself from the ship into the sea and felt
her body dissolving into foam.</p>

<p>The sun rose above the waves, and his warm
rays fell on the cold foam of the little mermaid,
who did not feel as if she were dying. She saw
the bright sun, and hundreds of transparent, beautiful
creatures floating around her&mdash;she could
see through them the white sails of the ships
and the red clouds in the sky. Their speech was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
melodious, but could not be heard by mortal ears&mdash;just
as their bodies could not be seen by mortal
eyes. The little mermaid perceived that she had
a body like theirs and that she continued to rise
higher and higher out of the foam. "Where am
I?" asked she, and her voice sounded ethereal,
like the voices of those who were with her. No
earthly music could imitate it.</p>

<p>"Among the daughters of the air," answered
one of them. "A mermaid has not an immortal
soul, nor can she obtain one unless she wins the
love of a human being. On the will of another
hangs her eternal destiny. But the daughters of
the air, although they do not possess an immortal
soul, can, by their good deeds, procure one
for themselves. We fly to warm countries and
cool the sultry air that destroys mankind with
the pestilence. We carry the perfume of the
flowers to spread health and restoration.</p>

<p>"After we have striven for three hundred years
to do all the good in our power, we receive an
immortal soul and take part in the happiness of
mankind. You, poor little mermaid, have tried
with your whole heart to do as we are doing.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
You have suffered and endured, and raised yourself
to the spirit world by your good deeds, and
now, by striving for three hundred years in the
same way, you may obtain an immortal soul."</p>

<p>The little mermaid lifted her glorified eyes
toward the sun and, for the first time, felt them
filling with tears.</p>

<p>On the ship in which she had left the prince
there were life and noise, and she saw him and
his beautiful bride searching for her. Sorrowfully
they gazed at the pearly foam, as if they knew
she had thrown herself into the waves. Unseen
she kissed the forehead of the bride and fanned
the prince, and then mounted with the other
children of the air to a rosy cloud that floated
above.</p>

<p>"After three hundred years, thus shall we
float into the kingdom of heaven," said she.
"And we may even get there sooner," whispered
one of her companions. "Unseen we can enter
the houses of men where there are children, and
for every day on which we find a good child that
is the joy of his parents and deserves their love,
our time of probation is shortened. The child<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
does not know, when we fly through the room,
that we smile with joy at his good conduct&mdash;for
we can count one year less of our three hundred
years. But when we see a naughty or a wicked
child we shed tears of sorrow, and for every tear
a day is added to our time of trial."</p>

singed, as if a flame of fire had passed over it.
And should you ask the reason, a farmer will
tell you, "The lightning did that."</div>

<p>But how is it that the lightning did it?</p>

<p>I will tell you what the sparrow told me, and
the sparrow heard it from an aged willow which
stood&mdash;and still stands for that matter&mdash;close
to the field of buckwheat.</p>

<p>This willow is tall and venerable, though old
and crippled. Its trunk is split clear through the
middle, and grass and blackberry tendrils creep
out through the cleft. The tree bends forward,
and its branches droop like long, green hair.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>In the fields around the willow grew rye,
wheat, and oats&mdash;beautiful oats that, when ripe,
looked like little yellow canary birds sitting on
a branch. The harvest had been blessed, and the
fuller the ears of grain the lower they bowed
their heads in reverent humility.</p>

<p>There was also a field of buckwheat lying just
in front of the old willow. The buckwheat did
not bow its head, like the rest of the grain, but
stood erect in stiff-necked pride.</p>

<p>"I am quite as rich as the oats," it said; "and,
moreover, I am much more sightly. My flowers
are as pretty as apple blossoms. It is a treat to
look at me and my companions. Old willow, do
you know anything more beautiful than we?"</p>

<p>The willow nodded his head, as much as to
say, "Indeed I do!" But the buckwheat was so
puffed with pride that it only said: "The stupid
tree! He is so old that grass is growing out of
his body."</p>

<p>Now there came on a dreadful storm, and the
flowers of the field folded their leaves or bent
their heads as it passed over them. The buckwheat
flower alone stood erect in all its pride.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>"Bow your heads, as we do," called the flowers.</p>

<p>"There is no need for me to do that," answered
the buckwheat.</p>

<p>"Bow your head as we do," said the grain.
"The angel of storms comes flying hither. He
has wings that reach from the clouds to the earth;
he will smite you before you have time to beg for
mercy."</p>

<p>"But I do not choose to bow down," said the
buckwheat.</p>

<p>"Close your flowers and fold your leaves," said
the old willow. "Do not look at the lightning
when the cloud breaks. Even human beings dare
not do that, for in the midst of the lightning one
may look straight into God's heaven. The sight
strikes human beings blind, so dazzling is it.
What would not happen to us, mere plants of
the field, who are so much humbler, if we should
dare do so?"</p>

<p>"So much humbler! Indeed! If there is a
chance, I shall look right into God's heaven."
And in its pride and haughtiness it did so.
The flashes of lightning were so awful that it
seemed as if the whole world were in flames.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>When the tempest was over, both the grain and
the flowers, greatly refreshed by the rain, again
stood erect in the pure, quiet air. But the buckwheat
had been burned as black as a cinder by
the lightning and stood in the field like a dead,
useless weed.</p>

<p>The old willow waved his branches to and fro
in the wind, and large drops of water fell from his
green leaves, as if he were shedding tears. The
sparrows asked: "Why are you weeping when
all around seems blest? Do you not smell the
sweet perfume of flowers and bushes? The sun
shines, and the clouds have passed from the sky.
Why do you weep, old tree?"</p>

<p>Then the willow told them of the buckwheat's
stubborn pride and of the punishment which
followed.</p>

<p>I, who tell this tale, heard it from the sparrows.
They told it to me one evening when I had asked
them for a story.</p>

</div>


<h2>WHAT HAPPENED TO THE THISTLE</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 101px;">
<img src="images/drop-a.png" width="101" height="100" alt="A" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'>ROUND a lordly old mansion was a
beautiful, well-kept garden, full of all
kinds of rare trees and flowers. Guests
always expressed their delight and admiration at
the sight of its wonders. The people from far
and near used to come on Sundays and holidays
and ask permission to see it. Even whole schools
made excursions for the sole purpose of seeing
its beauties.</div>

<p>Near the fence that separated the garden from
the meadow stood an immense thistle. It was an
uncommonly large and fine thistle, with several
branches spreading out just above the root, and
altogether was so strong and full as to make it
well worthy of the name "thistle bush."</p>

<p>No one ever noticed it, save the old donkey that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
pulled the milk cart for the dairymaids. He stood
grazing in the meadow hard by and stretched
his old neck to reach the thistle, saying: "You
are beautiful! I should like to eat you!" But
the tether was too short to allow him to reach
the thistle, so he did not eat it.</p>

<p>There were guests at the Hall, fine, aristocratic
relatives from town, and among them a
young lady who had come from a long distance&mdash;all
the way from Scotland. She was of old
and noble family and rich in gold and lands&mdash;a
bride well worth the winning, thought more
than one young man to himself; yes, and their
mothers thought so, too!</p>

<p>The young people amused themselves on the
lawn, playing croquet and flitting about among
the flowers, each young girl gathering a flower
to put in the buttonhole of some one of the
gentlemen.</p>

<p>The young Scotch lady looked about for a
flower, but none of them seemed to please her,
until, happening to glance over the fence, she
espied the fine, large thistle bush, full of bluish-red,
sturdy-looking flowers. She smiled as she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
saw it, and begged the son of the house to get
one of them for her.</p>

<p>"That is Scotland's flower," she said; "it
grows and blossoms in our coat of arms. Get
that one yonder for me, please."</p>

<p>And he gathered the finest of the thistle flowers,
though he pricked his fingers as much in
doing so as if it had been growing on a wild
rosebush.</p>

<p>She took the flower and put it in his buttonhole,
which made him feel greatly honored.
Each of the other young men would gladly have
given up his graceful garden flower if he might
have worn the one given by the delicate hands
of the Scotch girl. As keenly as the son of the
house felt the honor conferred upon him, the
thistle felt even more highly honored. It seemed
to feel dew and sunshine going through it.</p>

<p>"It seems I am of more consequence than I
thought," it said to itself. "I ought by rights to
stand inside and not outside the fence. One gets
strangely placed in this world, but now I have
at least one of my flowers over the fence&mdash;and
not only there, but in a buttonhole!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>To each one of its buds as it opened, the
thistle bush told this great event. And not
many days had passed before it heard&mdash;not
from the people who passed, nor yet from the
twittering of little birds, but from the air, which
gives out, far and wide, the sounds that it has
treasured up from the shadiest walks of the
beautiful garden and from the most secluded
rooms at the Hall, where doors and windows
are left open&mdash;that the young man who received
the thistle flower from the hands of the
Scottish maiden had received her heart and
hand as well.</p>

<p>"That is my doing!" said the thistle, thinking
of the flower she had given to the buttonhole.
And every new flower that came was told
of this wonderful event.</p>

<p>"Surely I shall now be taken and planted in
the garden," thought the thistle. "Perhaps I
shall be put into a flowerpot, for that is by far
the most honorable position." It thought of this
so long that it ended by saying to itself with
the firm conviction of truth, "I shall be planted
in a flowerpot!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>It promised every little bud that came that it
also should be placed in a pot and perhaps have
a place in a buttonhole&mdash;that being the highest
position one could aspire to. But none of them
got into a flowerpot, and still less into a gentleman's
buttonhole.</p>

<p>They lived on light and air, and drank sunshine
in the day and dew at night. They received
visits from bee and hornet, who came to
look for the honey in the flower, and who took
the honey and left the flower.</p>

<p>"The good-for-nothing fellows," said the thistle
bush. "I would pierce them if I could!"</p>

<p>The flowers drooped and faded, but new ones
always came.</p>

<p>"You come as if you had been sent," said the
thistle bush to them. "I am expecting every
moment to be taken over the fence."</p>

<p>A couple of harmless daisies and a huge, thin
plant of canary grass listened to this with the
deepest respect, believing all they heard. The
old donkey, that had to pull the milk cart, cast
longing looks toward the blooming thistle and
tried to reach it, but his tether was too short.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
And the thistle bush thought and thought, so
much and so long, of the Scotch thistle&mdash;to
whom it believed itself related&mdash;that at last it
fancied it had come from Scotland and that its
parents had grown into the Scottish arms.</p>

<p>It was a great thought, but a great thistle
may well have great thoughts.</p>

<p>"Sometimes one is of noble race even if one
does not know it," said the nettle growing close
by&mdash;it had a kind of presentiment that it might
be turned into muslin, if properly treated.</p>

<p>The summer passed, and the autumn passed;
the leaves fell from the trees; the flowers came
with stronger colors and less perfume; the gardener's
lad sang on the other side of the fence:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Up the hill and down the hill,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">That's the way of the world still."</span><br />
</div>

<p>The young pine trees in the wood began to
feel a longing for Christmas, though Christmas
was still a long way off.</p>

<p>"Here I am still," said the thistle. "It seems
that I am quite forgotten, and yet it was I who
made the match. They were engaged, and now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
they are married&mdash;the wedding was a week
ago. I do not make a single step forward, for
I cannot."</p>

<p>Some weeks passed. The thistle had its last,
solitary flower, which was large and full and growing
down near the root. The wind blew coldly
over it, the color faded, and all its glory disappeared,
leaving only the cup of the flower, now
grown to be as large as the flower of an artichoke
and glistening like a silvered sunflower.</p>

<p>The young couple, who were now man and
wife, came along the garden path, and as they
passed near the fence, the bride, glancing over
it, said, "Why, there stands the large thistle! it
has no flowers now."</p>

<p>"Yes, there is still the ghost of the last one,"
said her husband, pointing to the silvery remains
of the last flower&mdash;a flower in itself.</p>

<p>"How beautiful it is!" she said. "We must
have one carved in the frame of our picture."</p>

<p>And once more the young man had to get
over the fence, to break off the silvery cup of the
thistle flower. It pricked his fingers for his pains,
because he had called it a ghost. And then it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
was brought into the garden, and to the Hall,
and into the drawing room. There stood a large
picture&mdash;the portraits of the two, and in the
bridegroom's buttonhole was painted a thistle.
They talked of it and of the flower cup they had
brought in with them&mdash;the last silver-shimmering
thistle flower, that was to be reproduced in the
carving of the frame.</p>

<p>The air took all their words and scattered
them about, far and wide.</p>

<p>"What strange things happen to one!" said
the thistle bush. "My first-born went to live in
a buttonhole, my last-born in a frame! I wonder
what is to become of me."</p>

<p>The old donkey, standing by the roadside, cast
loving glances at the thistle and said, "Come to
me, my sweetheart, for I cannot go to you; my
tether is too short!"</p>

<p>But the thistle bush made no answer. It grew
more and more thoughtful, and it thought as
far ahead as Christmas, till its budding thoughts
opened into flower.</p>

<p>"When one's children are safely housed, a
mother is quite content to stay beyond the fence."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>"That is true," said the sunshine; "and you
will be well placed, never fear."</p>

<p>"In a flowerpot or in a frame?" asked the
thistle.</p>

<p>"In a story," answered the sunshine. And
here is the story!</p>

<h2>THE PEN AND THE INKSTAND</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 38px;">
<img src="images/drop-i.png" width="38" height="100" alt="I" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'>N A POET'S room, where his inkstand stood
on the table, the remark was once made: "It
is wonderful what can be brought out of an
inkstand. What will come next? It is indeed
wonderful."</div>

<p>"Yes, certainly," said the inkstand to the pen
and to the other articles that stood on the table;
"that's what I always say. It is wonderful and
extraordinary what a number of things come out
of me. It's quite incredible, and I really never
know what is coming next when that man dips
his pen into me. One drop out of me is enough
for half a page of paper&mdash;and what cannot half
a page contain?</p>

<p>"From me all the works of the poet are
produced&mdash;all those imaginary characters whom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
people fancy they have known or met, and all
the deep feeling, the humor, and the vivid pictures
of nature. I myself don't understand how
it is, for I am not acquainted with nature, but it
is certainly in me. From me have gone forth to
the world those wonderful descriptions of charming
maidens, and of brave knights on prancing
steeds; of the halt and the blind&mdash;and I know
not what more, for I assure you I never think
of these things."</p>

<p>"There you are right," said the pen, "for you
don't think at all. If you did, you would see
that you can only provide the means. You give
the fluid, that I may place upon the paper what
dwells in me and what I wish to bring to light.
It is the pen that writes. No man doubts that;
and indeed most people understand as much
about poetry as an old inkstand."</p>

<p>"You have had very little experience," replied
the inkstand. "You have hardly been in service
a week and are already half worn out. Do you
imagine you are a poet? You are only a servant,
and before you came I had many like you,
some of the goose family and others of English<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
manufacture. I know a quill pen as well as I know
a steel one. I have had both sorts in my service,
and I shall have many more as long as <i>he</i> comes&mdash;the
man who performs the mechanical part&mdash;and
writes down what he obtains from me. I
should like to know what will be the next thing
he gets out of me."</p>

<p>"Inkpot!" retorted the pen, contemptuously.</p>

<p>Late in the evening the poet returned home
from a concert, where he had been quite enchanted
by the admirable performance of a
famous violin player.</p>

<p>The player had produced from his instrument
a richness of tone that sometimes sounded like
tinkling water drops or rolling pearls, sometimes
like the birds twittering in chorus, and then
again, rising and swelling like the wind through
the fir trees. The poet felt as if his own heart
were weeping, but in tones of melody, like the
sound of a woman's voice. These sounds seemed
to come not only from the strings but from every
part of the instrument. It was a wonderful performance
and a difficult piece, and yet the bow
seemed to glide across the strings so easily that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
one would think any one could do it. The violin
and the bow seemed independent of their master
who guided them. It was as if soul and spirit
had been breathed into the instrument. And the
audience forgot the performer in the beautiful
sounds he produced.</p>

<p>Not so the poet; he remembered him and
wrote down his thoughts on the subject: "How
foolish it would be for the violin and the bow to
boast of their performance, and yet we men often
commit that folly. The poet, the artist, the man
of science in his laboratory, the general&mdash;we all
do it, and yet we are only the instruments which
the Almighty uses. To Him alone the honor is
due. We have nothing in ourselves of which we
should be proud." Yes, this is what the poet
wrote. He wrote it in the form of a parable and
called it "The Master and the Instruments."</p>

<p>"That is what you get, madam," said the pen
to the inkstand when the two were alone again.
"Did you hear him read aloud what I had written
down?"</p>

<p>"Yes, what I gave you to write," retorted the
inkstand. "That was a cut at you, because of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
your conceit. To think that you could not understand
that you were being quizzed! I gave
you a cut from within me. Surely I must know
my own satire."</p>

<p>"Ink pitcher!" cried the pen.</p>

<p>"Writing stick!" retorted the inkstand. And
each of them felt satisfied that he had given a
good answer. It is pleasing to be convinced that
you have settled a matter by your reply; it is
something to make you sleep well. And they
both slept well over it.</p>

<p>But the poet did not sleep. Thoughts rose
within him, like the tones of the violin, falling
like pearls or rushing like the strong wind through
the forest. He understood his own heart in these
thoughts; they were as a ray from the mind of
the Great Master of all minds.</p>

<p>"To Him be all the honor."</p>

<h2>THE TEAPOT</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 83px;">
<img src="images/drop-t.png" width="83" height="100" alt="T" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'>HERE was once a proud teapot; it was
proud of being porcelain, proud of its long
spout, proud of its broad handle. It had
something before and behind,&mdash;the spout before
and the handle behind,&mdash;and that was what it
talked about. But it did not talk of its lid, which
was cracked and riveted; these were defects, and
one does not talk of one's defects, for there are
plenty of others to do that. The cups, the cream
pot, and the sugar bowl, the whole tea service,
would think much oftener of the lid's imperfections&mdash;and
talk about them&mdash;than of the sound handle
and the remarkable spout. The teapot knew it.</div>

<p>"I know you," it said within itself. "I know,
too, my imperfection, and I am well aware that in
that very thing is seen my humility, my modesty.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
Imperfections we all have, but we also have
compensations. The cups have a handle, the
sugar bowl a lid; I have both, and one thing
besides, in front, which they can never have. I
have a spout, and that makes me the queen of
the tea table. I spread abroad a blessing on
thirsting mankind, for in me the Chinese leaves
are brewed in the boiling, tasteless water."</p>

<p>All this said the teapot in its fresh young
life. It stood on the table that was spread for
tea; it was lifted by a very delicate hand, but
the delicate hand was awkward. The teapot fell,
the spout snapped off, and the handle snapped
off. The lid was no worse to speak of; the
worst had been spoken of that.</p>

<p>The teapot lay in a swoon on the floor, while
the boiling water ran out of it. It was a horrid
shame, but the worst was that everybody jeered
at it; they jeered at the teapot and not at the
awkward hand.</p>

<p>"I never shall forget that experience," said the
teapot, when it afterward talked of its life. "I
was called an invalid, and placed in a corner,
and the next day was given to a woman who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
begged for victuals. I fell into poverty, and stood
dumb both outside and in. But then, just as I
was, began my better life. One can be one thing
and still become quite another.</p>

<p>"Earth was placed in me. For a teapot, this is
the same as being buried, but in the earth was
placed a flower bulb. Who placed it there, who
gave it, I know not; but given it was, and it
became a compensation for the Chinese leaves
and the boiling water, a compensation for the
broken handle and spout.</p>

<p>"And the bulb lay in the earth, the bulb lay
in me; it became my heart, my living heart, such
as I had never before possessed. There was life
in me, power and might. The heart pulsed, and
the bulb put forth sprouts; it was the springing
up of thoughts and feelings which burst forth
into flower.</p>

<p>"I saw it, I bore it, I forgot myself in its delight.
Blessed is it to forget oneself in another.
The flower gave me no thanks; it did not think
of me. It was admired and praised, and I was
glad at that. How happy it must have been!
One day I heard some one say that the flower<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
deserved a better pot. I was thumped hard on
my back, which was a great affliction, and the
flower was put into a better pot. I was thrown
out into the yard, where I lie as an old potsherd.
But I have the memory, and that I can
never lose."</p>

<h2>SOUP FROM A SAUSAGE SKEWER</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 159px;">
<img src="images/drop-wquote.png" width="159" height="100" alt="W" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'>E HAD such an excellent dinner
yesterday," said an old lady-mouse to
another who had not been present
at the feast. "I sat number twenty-one below the
mouse-king, which was not a bad place. Shall I
tell you what we had? Everything was excellent&mdash;moldy
bread, tallow candle, and sausage.</div>

<p>"Then, when we had finished that course, the
same came on all over again; it was as good as
two feasts. We were very sociable, and there was
as much joking and fun as if we had been all of one
family circle. Nothing was left but the sausage
skewers, and this formed a subject of conversation
till at last some one used the expression, 'Soup from
sausage sticks'; or, as the people in the neighboring
country call it, 'Soup from a sausage skewer.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>"Every one had heard the expression, but no
one had ever tasted the soup, much less prepared
it. A capital toast was drunk to the inventor of
the soup, and some one said he ought to be made
a relieving officer to the poor. Was not that
witty?</p>

<p>"Then the old mouse-king rose and promised
that the young lady-mouse who should learn how
best to prepare this much-admired and savory
soup should be his queen, and a year and a day
should be allowed for the purpose."</p>

<p>"That was not at all a bad proposal," said the
other mouse; "but how is the soup made?"</p>

<p>"Ah, that is more than I can tell you. All
the young lady-mice were asking the same question.
They wish very much to be the queen,
but they do not want to take the trouble to go
out into the world to learn how to make soup,
which it is absolutely necessary to do first.</p>

<p>"It is not every one who would care to leave
her family or her happy corner by the fireside
at home, even to be made queen. It is not
always easy in foreign lands to find bacon and
cheese rind every day, and, after all, it is not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
pleasant to endure hunger and perhaps be eaten
alive by the cat."</p>

<p>Probably some such thoughts as these discouraged
the majority from going out into the world
to collect the required information. Only four
mice gave notice that they were ready to set out
on the journey.</p>

<p>They were young and sprightly, but poor.
Each of them wished to visit one of the four
divisions of the world, to see which of them
would be most favored by fortune. Each took
a sausage skewer as a traveler's staff and to
remind her of the object of her journey.</p>

<p>They left home early in May, and none of
them returned till the first of May in the following
year, and then only three of them. Nothing
was seen or heard of the fourth, although the
day of decision was close at hand. "Ah, yes,
there is always some trouble mingled with the
greatest pleasure," said the mouse-king. But he
gave orders that all the mice within a circle of
many miles should be invited at once.</p>

<p>They were to assemble in the kitchen, and the
three travelers were to stand in a row before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
them, and a sausage skewer covered with crape
was to stand in the place of the missing mouse.
No one dared express an opinion until the king
spoke and desired one of them to proceed with
her story. And now we shall hear what she said.</p>


<div class='center'><br />WHAT THE FIRST LITTLE MOUSE SAW AND HEARD ON HER TRAVELS</div>

<p>"When I first went out into the world," said
the little mouse, "I fancied, as so many of my
age do, that I already knew everything&mdash;but
it was not so. It takes years to acquire great
knowledge.</p>

<p>"I went at once to sea, in a ship bound for
the north. I had been told that the ship's cook
must know how to prepare every dish at sea,
and it is easy enough to do that with plenty of
sides of bacon, and large tubs of salt meat and
musty flour. There I found plenty of delicate
food but no opportunity to learn how to make
soup from a sausage skewer.</p>

<p>"We sailed on for many days and nights; the
ship rocked fearfully, and we did not escape
without a wetting. As soon as we arrived at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
the port to which the ship was bound, I left it
and went on shore at a place far towards the
north. It is a wonderful thing to leave your
own little corner at home, to hide yourself in a
ship where there are sure to be some nice snug
corners for shelter, then suddenly to find yourself
thousands of miles away in a foreign land.</p>

<p>"I saw large, pathless forests of pine and birch
trees, which smelt so strong that I sneezed and
thought of sausage. There were great lakes also,
which looked as black as ink at a distance but
were quite clear when I came close to them.
Large swans were floating upon them, and I
thought at first they were only foam, they lay
so still; but when I saw them walk and fly, I
knew directly what they were. They belonged
to the goose species. One could see that by
their walk, for no one can successfully disguise
his family descent.</p>

<p>"I kept with my own kind and associated
with the forest and field mice, who, however,
knew very little&mdash;especially about what I wanted
to know and what had actually made me travel
abroad.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>"The idea that soup could be made from a
sausage skewer was so startling to them that it
was repeated from one to another through the
whole forest. They declared that the problem
would never be solved&mdash;that the thing was an
impossibility. How little I thought that in this
place, on the very first night, I should be
initiated into the manner of its preparation!</p>

<p>"It was the height of summer, which the mice
told me was the reason that the forest smelt so
strong, and that the herbs were so fragrant, and
that the lakes with the white, swimming swans
were so dark and yet so clear.</p>

<p>"On the margin of the wood, near several
houses, a pole as large as the mainmast of a ship
had been erected, and from the summit hung
wreaths of flowers and fluttering ribbons. It was
the Maypole. Lads and lasses danced round it
and tried to outdo the violins of the musicians
with their singing. They were as gay as ever at
sunset and in the moonlight, but I took no part
in the merrymaking. What has a little mouse
to do with a Maypole dance? I sat in the soft
moss and held my sausage skewer tight. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
moon shone particularly bright on one spot where
stood a tree covered with very fine moss. I may
almost venture to say that it was as fine and soft
as the fur of the mouse-king, but it was green,
which is a color very agreeable to the eye.</p>

<p>"All at once I saw the most charming little
people marching towards me. They did not reach
higher than my knee, although they looked like
human beings but were better proportioned.
They called themselves elves, and wore clothes
that were very delicate and fine, for they were
made of the leaves of flowers, trimmed with the
wings of flies and gnats. The effect was by no
means bad.</p>

<p>"They seemed to be seeking something&mdash;I
knew not what, till at last one of them espied
me. They came towards me, and the foremost
pointed to my sausage skewer, saying: 'There,
that is just what we want. See, it is pointed at the
top; is it not capital?' The longer he looked at
my pilgrim's staff the more delighted he became.</p>

<p>"'I will lend it to you,' said I, 'but not to keep.'</p>

<p>"'Oh, no, we won't keep it!' they all cried.
Then they seized the skewer, which I gave up to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
them, and dancing with it to the tree covered
with delicate moss, set it up in the middle of the
green. They wanted a Maypole, and the one
they now had seemed made especially for them.
This they decorated so beautifully that it was
quite dazzling to look at. Little spiders spun
golden threads around it, and it was hung with
fluttering veils and flags, as delicately white as
snow glittering in the moonlight. Then they
took colors from the butterfly's wing, sprinkling
them over the white drapery until it gleamed as
if covered with flowers and diamonds, and I
could no longer recognize my sausage skewer.
Such a Maypole as this has never been seen in
all the world.</p>

<p>"Then came a great company of real elves.
Nothing could be finer than their clothes. They
invited me to be present at the feast, but I was
to keep at a certain distance because I was too
large for them. Then began music that sounded
like a thousand glass bells, and was so full and
strong that I thought it must be the song of the
swans. I fancied also that I heard the voices of
the cuckoo and the blackbird, and it seemed at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
last as if the whole forest sent forth glorious
melodies&mdash;the voices of children, the tinkling of
bells, and the songs of the birds. And all this
wonderful melody came from the elfin Maypole.
My sausage peg was a complete peal of bells. I
could scarcely believe that so much could have
been produced from it, till I remembered into
what hands it had fallen. I was so much affected
that I wept tears such as a little mouse can weep,
but they were tears of joy.</p>

<p>"The night was far too short for me; there are
no long nights there in summer, as we often have
in this part of the world. When the morning
dawned and the gentle breeze rippled the glassy
mirror of the forest lake, all the delicate veils and
flags fluttered away into thin air. The waving
garlands of the spider's web, the hanging bridges
and galleries, or whatever else they may be called,
vanished away as if they had never been. Six
elves brought me back my sausage skewer and
at the same time asked me to make any request,
which they would grant if it lay in their power.
So I begged them, if they could, to tell me how
to make soup from a sausage skewer.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>"'How do we make it?' asked the chief of the
elves, with a smile. 'Why, you have just seen us.
You scarcely knew your sausage skewer again, I
am sure.'</p>

<p>"'They think themselves very wise,' thought I
to myself. Then I told them all about it, and
why I had traveled so far, and also what promise
had been made at home to the one who should
discover the method of preparing this soup.</p>

<p>"'What good will it do the mouse-king or our
whole mighty kingdom,' I asked, 'for me to have
seen all these beautiful things? I cannot shake the
sausage peg and say, "Look, here is the skewer,
and now the soup will come." That would only
produce a dish to be served when people were
keeping a fast.'</p>

<p>"Then the elf dipped his finger into the cup
of a violet and said, 'Look, I will anoint your
pilgrim's staff, so that when you return to your
home and enter the king's castle, you have only
to touch the king with your staff and violets will
spring forth, even in the coldest winter time. I
think I have given you something worth carrying
home, and a little more than something.'"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>Before the little mouse explained what this
something more was, she stretched her staff
toward the king, and as it touched him the most
beautiful bunch of violets sprang forth and filled
the place with their perfume. The smell was so
powerful that the mouse-king ordered the mice
who stood nearest the chimney to thrust their
tails into the fire that there might be a smell of
burning, for the perfume of the violets was overpowering
and not the sort of scent that every
one liked.</p>

<p>"But what was the something more, of which
you spoke just now?" asked the mouse-king.</p>

<p>"Why," answered the little mouse, "I think it
is what they call 'effect.'" Thereupon she turned
the staff round, and behold, not a single flower
was to be seen on it! She now held only the
naked skewer, and lifted it up as a conductor
lifts his baton at a concert.</p>

<p>"Violets, the elf told me," continued the
mouse, "are for the sight, the smell, and the
touch; so we have only to produce the effect of
hearing and tasting." Then, as the little mouse
beat time with her staff, there came sounds of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
music; not such music as was heard in the forest,
at the elfin feast, but such as is often heard in
the kitchen&mdash;the sounds of boiling and roasting.
It came quite suddenly, like wind rushing
through the chimneys, and it seemed as if every
pot and kettle were boiling over.</p>

<p>The fire shovel clattered down on the brass
fender, and then, quite as suddenly, all was still,&mdash;nothing
could be heard but the light, vapory
song of the teakettle, which was quite wonderful
to hear, for no one could rightly distinguish
whether the kettle was just beginning to boil or
just going to stop. And the little pot steamed,
and the great pot simmered, but without any
regard for each other; indeed, there seemed no
sense in the pots at all. As the little mouse
waved her baton still more wildly, the pots
foamed and threw up bubbles and boiled over,
while again the wind roared and whistled through
the chimney, and at last there was such a terrible
hubbub that the little mouse let her stick fall.</p>

<p>"That is a strange sort of soup," said the
mouse-king. "Shall we not now hear about the
preparation?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>"That is all," answered the little mouse, with
a bow.</p>

<p>"That all!" said the mouse-king; "then we
shall be glad to hear what information the next
may have to give us."</p>


<div class='center'><br />WHAT THE SECOND MOUSE HAD TO TELL</div>

<p>"I was born in the library, at a castle," said
the second mouse. "Very few members of our
family ever had the good fortune to get into
the dining room, much less into the storeroom.
To-day and while on my journey are the only
times I have ever seen a kitchen. We were often
obliged to suffer hunger in the library, but we
gained a great deal of knowledge. The rumor
reached us of the royal prize offered to those who
should be able to make soup from a sausage skewer.</p>

<p>"Then my old grandmother sought out a
manuscript,&mdash;which she herself could not read, to
be sure, but she had heard it read,&mdash;and in it
were written these words, 'Those who are poets
can make soup of sausage skewers.' She asked
me if I was a poet. I told her I felt myself quite
innocent of any such pretensions. Then she said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
I must go out and make myself a poet. I asked
again what I should be required to do, for it
seemed to me quite as difficult as to find out how
to make soup of a sausage skewer. My grandmother
had heard a great deal of reading in her
day, and she told me that three principal qualifications
were necessary&mdash;understanding, imagination,
and feeling. 'If you can manage to acquire
these three, you will be a poet, and the sausage-skewer
soup will seem quite simple to you.'</p>

<p>"So I went forth into the world and turned
my steps toward the west, that I might become
a poet. Understanding is the most important
matter of all. I was sure of that, for the other
two qualifications are not thought much of; so I
went first to seek understanding. Where was I
to find it?</p>

<p>"'Go to the ant and learn wisdom,' said the
great Jewish king. I learned this from living in a
library. So I went straight on till I came to the
first great ant hill. There I set myself to watch,
that I might become wise. The ants are a very
respectable people; they are wisdom itself. All
they do is like the working of a sum in arithmetic,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
which comes right. 'To work, and to lay eggs,'
say they, 'and to provide for posterity, is to
live out your time properly.' This they truly do.
They are divided into clean and dirty ants, and
their rank is indicated by a number. The ant-queen
is number <span class="smcap">One</span>. Her opinion is the only
correct one on everything, and she seems to
have in her the wisdom of the whole world. This
was just what I wished to acquire. She said a
great deal that was no doubt very clever&mdash;yet it
sounded like nonsense to me. She said the ant
hill was the loftiest thing in the world, although
close to the mound stood a tall tree which no
one could deny was loftier, much loftier. Yet
she made no mention of the tree.</p>

<p>"One evening an ant lost herself on this tree.
She had crept up the stem, not nearly to the
top but higher than any ant had ever ventured,
and when at last she returned home she said
that she had found something in her travels
much higher than the ant hill. The rest of the
ants considered this an insult to the whole community,
and condemned her to wear a muzzle and
live in perpetual solitude.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>"A short time afterwards another ant got on
the tree and made the same journey and the
same discovery. But she spoke of it cautiously
and indefinitely, and as she was one of the superior
ants and very much respected, they believed
her. And when she died they erected an egg-shell
as a monument to her memory, for they
cultivated a great respect for science.</p>

<p>"I saw," said the little mouse, "that the ants
were always running to and fro with their burdens
on their backs. Once I saw one of them,
who had dropped her load, try very hard to raise
it again, but she did not succeed. Two others
came up and tried with all their strength to help
her, till they nearly dropped their own burdens.
Then they were obliged to stop a moment, for
every one must think of himself first. The ant-queen
remarked that their conduct that day
showed that they possessed kind hearts and
good understanding. 'These two qualities,' she
continued, 'place us ants in the highest degree
above all other reasonable beings. Understanding
must therefore stand out prominently among
us, and my wisdom is greatest.' So saying, she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
raised herself on her two hind legs, that no one
else might be mistaken for her. I could not,
therefore, have made a mistake, so I ate her up.
We are to go to the ants to learn wisdom, and
I had secured the queen.</p>

<p>"I now turned and went nearer to the lofty
tree already mentioned, which was an oak. It
had a tall trunk, with a wide-spreading top, and
was very old. I knew that a living being dwelt
here, a dryad, as she is called, who is born with
the tree and dies with it. I had heard this in
the library, and here was just such a tree and in
it an oak maiden. She uttered a terrible scream
when she caught sight of me so near to her.
Like women, she was very much afraid of mice,
and she had more real cause for fear than they
have, for I might have gnawed through the tree
on which her life depended.</p>

<p>"I spoke to her in a friendly manner and
begged her to take courage. At last she took
me up in her delicate hand, and I told her what
had brought me out into the world. She told
me that perhaps on that very evening she would
be able to obtain for me one of the two treasures<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
for which I was seeking. She told me that
Phant&aelig;sus, the genius of the imagination, was
her very dear friend; that he was as beautiful
as the god of love; that he rested many an hour
with her under the leafy boughs of the tree,
which then rustled and waved more than ever.
He called her his dryad, she said, and the tree
his tree, for the grand old oak with its gnarled
trunk was just to his taste. The root, which
spread deep into the earth, and the top, which
rose high in the fresh air, knew the value of the
drifting snow, the keen wind, and the warm sunshine,
as it ought to be known. 'Yes,' continued
the dryad, 'the birds sing up above in the
branches and talk to each other about the
beautiful fields they have visited in foreign
lands. On one of the withered boughs a stork
has built his nest&mdash;it is beautifully arranged,
and, besides, it is pleasant to hear a little about
the land of the pyramids. All this pleases
Phant&aelig;sus, but it is not enough for him. I am
obliged to relate to him of my life in the woods
and to go back to my childhood, when I was
little and the tree so small and delicate that a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
stinging nettle could overshadow it, and I have
to tell everything that has happened since then
until now, when the tree is so large and strong.
Sit you down now under the green bindwood
and pay attention. When Phant&aelig;sus comes I
will find an opportunity to lay hold of his wing
and to pull out one of the little feathers. That
feather you shall have. A better was never given
to any poet, and it will be quite enough for you.'</p>

<p>"And when Phant&aelig;sus came the feather was
plucked," said the little mouse, "and I seized and
put it in water and kept it there till it was quite
soft. It was very heavy and indigestible, but I
managed to nibble it up at last. It is not so easy
to nibble oneself into a poet, there are so many
things to get through. Now, however, I had
two of them, understanding and imagination, and
through these I knew that the third was to be
found in the library.</p>

<p>"A great man has said and written that there
are novels whose sole and only use appears to
be to attempt to relieve mankind of overflowing
tears&mdash;a kind of sponge, in fact, for sucking
up feelings and emotions. I remembered a few<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
of these books. They had always appeared
tempting to the appetite, for they had been
much read and were so greasy that they must
have absorbed no end of emotions in themselves.</p>

<p>"I retraced my steps to the library and literally
devoured a whole novel&mdash;that is, properly
speaking, the interior, or soft part of it. The
crust, or binding, I left. When I had digested
not only this, but a second, I felt a stirring
within me. I then ate a small piece of a third
romance and felt myself a poet. I said it to myself
and told others the same. I had headache
and backache and I cannot tell what aches
besides. I thought over all the stories that may
be said to be connected with sausage pegs; and
all that has ever been written about skewers,
and sticks, and staves, and splinters came to my
thoughts&mdash;the ant-queen must have had a wonderfully
clear understanding. I remembered the
man who placed in his mouth a white stick, by
which he could make himself and the stick
invisible. I thought of sticks as hobbyhorses,
staves of music or rime, of breaking a stick over
a man's back, and of Heaven knows how many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
more phrases of the same sort, relating to sticks,
staves, and skewers. All my thoughts ran on
skewers, sticks of wood, and staves. As I am at
last a poet and have worked terribly hard to
make myself one, I can of course make poetry
on anything. I shall therefore be able to wait
upon you every day in the week with a poetical
history of a skewer. And that is my soup."</p>

<p>"In that case," said the mouse-king, "we will
hear what the third mouse has to say."</p>

<p>"Squeak, squeak," cried a little mouse at the
kitchen door. It was the fourth, and not the
third, of the four who were contending for
the prize, the one whom the rest supposed to
be dead. She shot in like an arrow and overturned
the sausage peg that had been covered
with crape. She had been running day and
night, for although she had traveled in a baggage
train, by railway, yet she had arrived almost
too late. She pressed forward, looking very much
ruffled.</p>

<p>She had lost her sausage skewer but not her
voice, and she began to speak at once, as if they
waited only for her and would hear her only&mdash;as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
if nothing else in the world were of the least consequence.
She spoke out so clearly and plainly,
and she had come in so suddenly, that no one
had time to stop her or to say a word while she
was speaking. This is what she said.</p>


<div class='center'><br />WHAT THE FOURTH MOUSE, WHO SPOKE BEFORE THE THIRD, HAD TO TELL</div>

<p>"I started off at once to the largest town," said
she, "but the name of it has escaped me. I have
a very bad memory for names. I was carried from
the railway, with some goods on which duties had
not been paid, to the jail, and on arriving I made
my escape, running into the house of the keeper.
He was speaking of his prisoners, especially of
one who had uttered thoughtless words. These
words had given rise to other words, and at length
they were written down and registered. 'The
whole affair is like making soup of sausage
skewers,' said he, 'but the soup may cost him
his neck.'</p>

<p>"Now this raised in me an interest for the
prisoner," continued the little mouse, "and I
watched my opportunity and slipped into his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
apartment, for there is a mousehole to be found
behind every closed door.</p>

<p>"The prisoner, who had a great beard and
large, sparkling eyes, looked pale. There was a
lamp burning, but the walls were so black that
they only looked the blacker for it. The prisoner
scratched pictures and verses with white chalk
on the black walls, but I did not read the verses.
I think he found his confinement wearisome, so
that I was a welcome guest. He enticed me with
bread crumbs, with whistling, and with gentle
words, and seemed so friendly towards me that
by degrees I gained confidence in him and we
became friends. He divided his bread and water
with me and gave me cheese and sausage, and I
began to love him. Altogether, I must own that
it was a very pleasant intimacy. He let me run
about on his hand, on his arm, into his sleeve,
and even into his beard. He called me his little
friend, and I forgot for what I had come out into
the world; forgot my sausage skewer, which I
had laid in a crack in the floor, where it is
still lying. I wished to stay with him always,
for I knew that if I went away, the poor prisoner<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
would have no one to be his friend, which is a
sad thing.</p>

<p>"I stayed, but he did not. He spoke to me so
mournfully for the last time, gave me double as
much bread and cheese as usual, and kissed his
hand to me. Then he went away and never came
back. I know nothing more of his history.</p>

<p>"The jailer took possession of me now. He
said something about soup from a sausage skewer,
but I could not trust him. He took me in his
hand, certainly, but it was to place me in a
cage like a treadmill. Oh, how dreadful it was!
I had to run round and round without getting
any farther, and only to make everybody
laugh.</p>

<p>"The jailer's granddaughter was a charming
little thing. She had merry eyes, curly hair like
the brightest gold, and such a smiling mouth.</p>

<p>"'You poor little mouse,' said she one day, as
she peeped into my cage, 'I will set you free.'
She then drew forth the iron fastening, and I
sprang out on the window-sill, and from thence
to the roof. Free! free! that was all I could think
of, and not of the object of my journey.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>"It grew dark, and as night was coming on I
found a lodging in an old tower, where dwelt a
watchman and an owl. I had no confidence in
either of them, least of all in the owl, which is
like a cat and has a great failing, for she eats
mice. One may, however, be mistaken sometimes,
and I was now, for this was a respectable and
well-educated old owl, who knew more than the
watchman and even as much as I did myself.
The young owls made a great fuss about everything,
but the only rough words she would say to
them were, 'You had better go and try to make
some soup from sausage skewers.' She was
very indulgent and loving to her own children.
Her conduct gave me such confidence in her
that from the crack where I sat I called out
'Squeak.'</p>

<p>"This confidence pleased her so much that
she assured me she would take me under her
own protection and that not a creature should do
me harm. The fact was, she wickedly meant to
keep me in reserve for her own eating in the
winter, when food would be scarce. Yet she was
a very clever lady-owl. She explained to me that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
the watchman could only hoot with the horn that
hung loose at his side and that he was so terribly
proud of it that he imagined himself an owl in
the tower, wanted to do great things, but only succeeded
in small&mdash;soup from a sausage skewer.</p>

<p>"Then I begged the owl to give me the recipe
for this soup. 'Soup from a sausage skewer,'
said she, 'is only a proverb amongst mankind
and may be understood in many ways. Each
believes his own way the best, and, after all,
the proverb signifies nothing.' 'Nothing!' I
exclaimed. I was quite struck. Truth is not
always agreeable, but truth is above everything
else, as the old owl said. I thought over all this
and saw quite plainly that if truth was really so
far above everything else, it must be much more
valuable than soup from a sausage skewer. So
I hastened to get away, that I might be in time
and bring what was highest and best and above
everything&mdash;namely, the truth.</p>

<p>"The mice are enlightened people, and the
mouse-king is above them all. He is therefore
capable of making me queen for the sake of
truth."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your truth is a falsehood," said the mouse
who had not yet spoken. "I can prepare the
soup, and I mean to do so."</p>


<div class='center'><br />HOW IT WAS PREPARED</div>

<p>"I did not travel," said the third mouse, "I
stayed in this country; that was the right way.
One gains nothing by traveling. Everything can
be acquired here quite as easily, so I stayed at
home. I have not obtained what I know from
supernatural beings; I have neither swallowed
it nor learned it from conversing with owls. I
have gained it all from my own reflections and
thoughts. Will you now set the kettle on the
fire&mdash;so? Now pour the water in, quite full up
to the brim; place it on the fire; make up a
good blaze; keep it burning, that the water may
boil, for it must boil over and over. There, now
I throw in the skewer. Will the mouse-king
be pleased now to dip his tail into the boiling
water and stir it round with the tail? The longer
the king stirs it the stronger the soup will become.
Nothing more is necessary, only to stir it."</p>

<p>"Can no one else do this?" asked the king.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>"No," said the mouse; "only in the tail of the
mouse-king is this power contained."</p>

<p>And the water boiled and bubbled, as the
mouse-king stood close beside the kettle. It
seemed rather a dangerous performance, but he
turned round and put out his tail, as mice do in
a dairy when they wish to skim the cream from
a pan of milk with their tails and afterwards
lick it off. But the mouse-king's tail had only
just touched the hot steam when he sprang away
from the chimney in a great hurry, exclaiming:</p>

<p>"Oh, certainly, by all means, you must be my
queen. We will let the soup question rest till
our golden wedding, fifty years hence, so that
the poor in my kingdom who are then to have
plenty of food will have something to look forward
to for a long time, with great joy."</p>

<p>And very soon the wedding took place. Many
of the mice, however, as they were returning home,
said that the soup could not be properly called
"soup from a sausage skewer," but "soup from a
mouse's tail." They acknowledged that some of
the stories were very well told, but thought that
the whole might have been managed differently.</p>

<h2>WHAT THE GOODMAN DOES IS ALWAYS RIGHT</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 38px;">
<img src="images/drop-i.png" width="38" height="100" alt="I" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'> &nbsp; WILL tell you a story that was told to me
when I was a little boy. Every time I think
of this story it seems to me more and more
charming; for it is with stories as it is with many
people&mdash;they become better as they grow older.</div>

<p>I have no doubt that you have been in the
country and seen a very old farmhouse, with
thatched roof, and mosses and small plants growing
wild upon it. There is a stork's nest on the
ridge of the gable, for we cannot do without the
stork. The walls of the house are sloping, and
the windows are low, and only one of the latter
is made to open. The baking oven sticks out of
the wall like a great knob. An elder tree hangs
over the palings, and beneath its branches, at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
foot of the paling, is a pool of water in which
a few ducks are sporting. There is a yard dog,
too, that barks at all comers.</p>

<p>Just such a farmhouse as this stood in a country
lane, and in it dwelt an old couple, a peasant
and his wife. Small as their possessions were,
they had one thing they could not do without,
and that was a horse, which contrived to live
upon the grass found by the side of the highroad.
The old peasant rode into the town upon
this horse, and his neighbors often borrowed it
of him and paid for the loan of it by rendering
some service to the old couple. Yet after a time
the old people thought it would be as well to
sell the horse or exchange it for something which
might be more useful to them. But what should
this <i>something</i> be?</p>

<p>"You will know best, old man," said the wife.
"It is fair day to-day; so ride into town and get
rid of the horse for money or make a good exchange.
Whichever you do will please me; so
ride to the fair."</p>

<p>She fastened his neckerchief for him, for she
could do that better than he could and she could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
also tie it very prettily in a double bow. She
also smoothed his hat round and round with the
palm of her hand and gave him a kiss. Then
he rode away upon the horse that was to be sold,
or bartered for something else. Yes, the goodman
knew what he was about. The sun shone
with great heat, and not a cloud was to be seen
in the sky. The road was very dusty, for many
people, all going to the fair, were driving, riding,
or walking upon it. There was no shelter anywhere
from the hot sun. Among the crowd a
man came trudging along, driving a cow to the
fair. The cow was as beautiful a creature as
any cow could be.</p>

<p>"She gives good milk, I am certain," said the
peasant to himself. "That would be a very good
exchange: the cow for the horse. Halloo there!
you with the cow," he said. "I tell you what, I
dare say a horse is of more value than a cow;
but I don't care for that. A cow will be more
useful to me, so if you like we'll exchange."</p>

<p>"To be sure I will," said the man.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 337px;">
<img src="images/p223i.png" width="337" height="500" alt="And then our peasant ... continued his way." title="" />
</div>

<p>Accordingly the exchange was made. When
the matter was settled the peasant might have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
turned back, for he had done the business he
came to do. But having made up his mind to
go to the fair, he determined to do so, if only to
have a look at it. So on he went to the town
with his cow. Leading the animal, he strode on
sturdily, and, after a short time, overtook a man
who was driving a sheep. It was a good fat
sheep, with a fine fleece on its back.</p>

<p>"I should like to have that fellow," said the
peasant to himself. "There is plenty of grass for
him by our palings, and in the winter we could
keep him in the room with us. Perhaps it would
be more profitable to have a sheep than a cow.
Shall I exchange?"</p>

<p>The man with the sheep was quite ready, and
the bargain was quickly made. And then our
peasant continued his way on the highroad with
his sheep. Soon after this, he overtook another
man, who had come into the road from a field,
and was carrying a large goose under his arm.</p>

<p>"What a heavy creature you have there!"
said the peasant. "It has plenty of feathers and
plenty of fat, and would look well tied to a string,
or paddling in the water at our place. That<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
would be very useful to my old woman; she
could make all sorts of profit out of it. How
often she has said, 'If we only had a goose!'
Now here is an opportunity, and, if possible, I
will get it for her. Shall we exchange? I will
give you my sheep for your goose, and thanks
into the bargain."</p>

<p>The other had not the least objection, and accordingly
the exchange was made, and our peasant
became possessor of the goose. By this time
he had arrived very near the town. The crowd
on the highroad had been gradually increasing,
and there was quite a rush of men and cattle.
The cattle walked on the path and by the palings,
and at the turnpike gate they even walked
into the toll keeper's potato field, where one fowl
was strutting about with a string tied to its leg,
lest it should take fright at the crowd and run
away and get lost. The tail feathers of this fowl
were very short, and it winked with both its
eyes, and looked very cunning as it said, "Cluck,
cluck." What were the thoughts of the fowl as
it said this I cannot tell you, but as soon as our
good man saw it, he thought, "Why, that's the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
finest fowl I ever saw in my life; it's finer than
our parson's brood hen, upon my word. I should
like to have that fowl. Fowls can always pick
up a few grains that lie about, and almost keep
themselves. I think it would be a good exchange
if I could get it for my goose. Shall we
exchange?" he asked the toll keeper.</p>

<p>"Exchange?" repeated the man. "Well, it
would not be a bad thing."</p>

<p>So they made an exchange; the toll keeper at
the turnpike gate kept the goose, and the peasant
carried off the fowl. Now he really had done
a great deal of business on his way to the fair,
and he was hot and tired. He wanted something
to eat, and a glass of ale to refresh himself; so he
turned his steps to an inn. He was just about to
enter, when the ostler came out, and they met at
the door. The ostler was carrying a sack. "What
have you in that sack?" asked the peasant.</p>

<p>"Rotten apples," answered the ostler; "a whole
sackful of them. They will do to feed the pigs
with."</p>

<p>"Why, that will be terrible waste," the peasant
replied. "I should like to take them home to my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
old woman. Last year the old apple tree by the
grassplot bore only one apple, and we kept it in
the cupboard till it was quite withered and rotten.
It was property, my old woman said. Here
she would see a great deal of property&mdash;a whole
sackful. I should like to show them to her."</p>

<p>"What will you give me for the sackful?"
asked the ostler.</p>

<p>"What will I give? Well, I will give you my
fowl in exchange."</p>

<p>So he gave up the fowl and received the apples,
which he carried into the inn parlor. He leaned
the sack carefully against the stove, and then
went to the table. But the stove was hot, and
he had not thought of that. Many guests were
present&mdash;horse-dealers, cattle-drovers, and two
Englishmen. The Englishmen were so rich that
their pockets bulged and seemed ready to burst;
and they could bet too, as you shall hear.
Hiss&mdash;s&mdash;s, hiss&mdash;s&mdash;s. What could that be by
the stove? The apples were beginning to roast.
"What is that?" asked one.</p>

<p>"Why, do you know&mdash;" said our peasant,
and then he told them the whole story of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
horse, which he had exchanged for a cow, and
all the rest of it, down to the apples.</p>

<p>"Well, your old woman will give it to you
when you get home," said one of the Englishmen.
"Won't there be a noise?"</p>

<p>"What! Give me what?" said the peasant.
"Why, she will kiss me, and say, 'What the
goodman does is always right.'"</p>

<p>"Let us lay a wager on it," said the Englishman.
"We'll wager you a ton of coined gold,
a hundred pounds to the hundredweight."</p>

<p>"No, a bushel will be enough," replied the
peasant. "I can only set a bushel of apples
against it, and I'll throw myself and my old
woman into the bargain. That will pile up the
measure, I fancy."</p>

<p>"Done! taken!" and so the bet was made.</p>

<p>Then the landlord's coach came to the door,
and the two Englishmen and the peasant got in,
and away they drove. Soon they had stopped at
the peasant's hut. "Good evening, old woman."</p>

<p>"Good evening, old man."</p>

<p>"I've made the exchange."</p>

<p>"Ah, well, you understand what you're about,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
said the woman. Then she embraced him, and
paid no attention to the strangers, nor did she
notice the sack.</p>

<p>"I got a cow in exchange for the horse."</p>

<p>"Oh, how delightful!" said she. "Now we shall
have plenty of milk, and butter, and cheese on
the table. That was a capital exchange."</p>

<p>"Yes, but I changed the cow for a sheep."</p>

<p>"Ah, better still!" cried the wife. "You
always think of everything; we have just enough
pasture for a sheep. Ewe's milk and cheese,
woolen jackets and stockings! The cow could
not give all these, and her hairs only fall off.
How you think of everything!"</p>

<p>"But I changed away the sheep for a goose."</p>

<p>"Then we shall have roast goose to eat this
year. You dear old man, you are always thinking
of something to please me. This is delightful.
We can let the goose walk about with a string
tied to her leg, so that she will get fatter still
before we roast her."</p>

<p>"But I gave away the goose for a fowl."</p>

<p>"A fowl! Well, that was a good exchange,"
replied the woman. "The fowl will lay eggs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
and hatch them, and we shall have chickens. We
shall soon have a poultry yard. Oh, this is just
what I was wishing for!"</p>

<p>"Yes, but I exchanged the fowl for a sack of
shriveled apples."</p>

<p>"What! I must really give you a kiss for
that!" exclaimed the wife. "My dear, good
husband, now I'll tell you something. Do you
know, almost as soon as you left me this morning,
I began thinking of what I could give you
nice for supper this evening, and then I thought
of fried eggs and bacon, with sweet herbs. I had
eggs and bacon but lacked the herbs, so I went
over to the schoolmaster's. I knew they had
plenty of herbs, but the schoolmistress is very
mean, although she can smile so sweetly. I
begged her to lend me a handful of herbs.
'Lend!' she exclaimed, 'I have nothing to lend.
I could not even lend you a shriveled apple, my
dear woman.' But now I can lend her ten, or a
whole sackful, for which I'm very glad. It makes
me laugh to think of it." Then she gave him a
hearty kiss.</p>

<p>"Well, I like all this," said both the Englishmen;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
"always going down the hill and yet always
merry. It's worth the money to see it." So they
paid a hundredweight of gold to the peasant
who, whatever he did, was not scolded but kissed.</p>

<p>Yes, it always pays best when the wife sees
and maintains that her husband knows best and
that whatever he does is right.</p>

<p>This is a story which I heard when I was a
child. And now you have heard it, too, and know
that "What the goodman does is always right."</p>

<h2>THE OLD STREET LAMP</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 102px;">
<img src="images/drop-d.png" width="102" height="100" alt="D" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'>ID you ever hear the story of the old
street lamp? It is not remarkably
interesting, but for once you may as
well listen to it.</div>

<p>It was a most respectable old lamp, which had
seen many, many years of service and now was
to retire with a pension. It was this very evening
at its post for the last time, giving light to the
street. Its feelings were something like those of
an old dancer at the theater who is dancing for
the last time and knows that on the morrow she
will be in her garret, alone and forgotten.</p>

<p>The lamp had very great anxiety about the
next day, for it knew that it had to appear for
the first time at the town hall to be inspected by
the mayor and the council, who were to decide<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
whether it was fit for further service; whether it
was good enough to be used to light the inhabitants
of one of the suburbs, or in the country, at
some factory. If the lamp could not be used for
one of these purposes, it would be sent at once
to an iron foundry to be melted down. In this
latter case it might be turned into anything, and
it wondered very much whether it would then be
able to remember that it had once been a street
lamp. This troubled it exceedingly.</p>

<p>Whatever might happen, it seemed certain that
the lamp would be separated from the watchman
and his wife, whose family it looked upon as its
own. The lamp had first been hung up on the
very evening that the watchman, then a robust
young man, had entered upon the duties of his
office. Ah, well! it was a very long time since one
became a lamp and the other a watchman. His
wife had some little pride in those days; she
condescended to glance at the lamp only when
she passed by in the evening&mdash;never in the daytime.
But in later years, when all of them&mdash;the
watchman, the wife, and the lamp&mdash;had
grown old, she had attended to it, cleaning it and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
keeping it supplied with oil. The old people were
thoroughly honest; they had never cheated the
lamp of a single drop of the oil provided for it.</p>

<p>This was the lamp's last night in the street,
and to-morrow it must go to the town hall&mdash;two
very dark things to think of. No wonder it did
not burn brightly. How many persons it had
lighted on their way, and how much it had seen!
As much, very likely, as the mayor and corporation
themselves! None of these thoughts were
uttered aloud, however, for the lamp was good
and honorable and would not willingly do harm
to any one, especially to those in authority. As
one thing after another was recalled to its mind,
the light would flash up with sudden brightness.
At such moments the lamp had a conviction that
it would be remembered.</p>

<p>"There was a handsome young man, once,"
thought the lamp; "it is certainly a long while
ago, but I remember that he had a little note,
written on pink paper with a gold edge. The
writing was elegant, evidently a lady's. Twice he
read it through, and kissed it, and then looked
up at me with eyes that said quite plainly, 'I am<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
the happiest of men!' Only he and I know what
was written on this, his first letter from his lady-love.
Ah, yes, and there was another pair of eyes
that I remember; it is really wonderful how the
thoughts jump from one thing to another! A
funeral passed through the street. A young and
beautiful woman lay on a bier decked with garlands
of flowers, and attended by torches which
quite overpowered my light. All along the street
stood the people from the houses, in crowds,
ready to join the procession. But when the
torches had passed from before me and I could
look around, I saw one person standing alone,
leaning against my post and weeping. Never
shall I forget the sorrowful eyes that looked up
at me."</p>

<p>These and similar reflections occupied the old
street lamp on this the last time that its light
would shine. The sentry, when he is relieved
from his post, knows, at least, who will be his successor,
and may whisper a few words to him. But
the lamp did not know its successor, or it might
have given him a few hints respecting rain or
mist and might have informed him how far the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
moon's rays would reach, and from which side the
wind generally blew, and so on.</p>

<p>On the bridge over the canal stood three persons
who wished to recommend themselves to
the lamp, for they thought it could give the
office to whomsoever it chose. The first was a
herring's head, which could emit light in the
darkness. He remarked that it would be a great
saving of oil if they placed him on the lamp-post.
Number two was a piece of rotten wood, which
also shines in the dark. He considered himself
descended from an old stem, once the pride of
the forest. The third was a glowworm, and
how he found his way there the lamp could not
imagine; yet there he was, and could really give
light as well as the others. But the rotten wood
and the herring's head declared most solemnly,
by all they held sacred, that the glowworm only
gave light at certain times and must not be
allowed to compete with them. The old lamp
assured them that not one of them could give
sufficient light to fill the position of a street
lamp, but they would believe nothing that it said.
When they discovered that it had not the power<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
of naming its successor, they said they were very
glad to hear it, for the lamp was too old and
worn out to make a proper choice.</p>

<p>At this moment the wind came rushing round
the corner of the street and through the air-holes
of the old lamp. "What is this I hear?"
it asked. "Are you going away to-morrow? Is
this evening the last time we shall meet? Then
I must present you with a farewell gift. I will
blow into your brain, so that in future not only
shall you be able to remember all that you have
seen or heard in the past, but your light within
shall be so bright that you will be able to understand
all that is said or done in your presence."</p>

<p>"Oh, that is really a very, very great gift," said
the old lamp. "I thank you most heartily. I only
hope I shall not be melted down."</p>

<p>"That is not likely to happen yet," said the
wind. "I will also blow a memory into you, so
that, should you receive other similar presents,
your old age will pass very pleasantly."</p>

<p>"That is, if I am not melted down," said the
lamp. "But should I, in that case, still retain
my memory?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do be reasonable, old lamp," said the wind,
puffing away.</p>

<p>At this moment the moon burst forth from
the clouds. "What will you give the old lamp?"
asked the wind.</p>

<p>"I can give nothing," she replied. "I am on
the wane, and no lamps have ever given me light,
while I have frequently shone upon them." With
these words the moon hid herself again behind
the clouds, that she might be saved from further
importunities. Just then a drop fell upon the
lamp from the roof of the house, but the drop explained
that it was a gift from those gray clouds
and perhaps the best of all gifts. "I shall penetrate
you so thoroughly," it said, "that you will
have the power of becoming rusty, and, if you
wish it, can crumble into dust in one night."</p>

<p>But this seemed to the lamp a very shabby
present, and the wind thought so, too. "Does no
one give any more? Will no one give any more?"
shouted the breath of the wind, as loud as it
could. Then a bright, falling star came down,
leaving a broad, luminous streak behind it.</p>

<p>"What was that?" cried the herring's head.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
"Did not a star fall? I really believe it went into
the lamp. Certainly, when such high-born personages
try for the office we may as well go home."</p>

<p>And so they did, all three, while the old lamp
threw a wonderfully strong light all around.</p>

<p>"This is a glorious gift," it said. "The bright
stars have always been a joy to me and have always
shone more brilliantly than I ever could
shine, though I have tried with my whole might.
Now they have noticed me, a poor old lamp, and
have sent me a gift that will enable me to see
clearly everything that I remember, as if it still
stood before me, and to let it be seen by all those
who love me. And herein lies the truest happiness,
for pleasures which we cannot share with
others are only half enjoyed."</p>

<p>"That sentiment does you honor," said the
wind; "but for this purpose wax lights will be
necessary. If these are not lighted in you, your
peculiar faculties will not benefit others in the
least. The stars have not thought of this. They
suppose that you and every other light must be a
wax taper. But I must go down now." So it laid
itself to rest.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>"Wax tapers, indeed!" said the lamp; "I have
never yet had these, nor is it likely I ever
shall. If I could only be sure of not being
melted down!"</p>

<p>The next day&mdash;well, perhaps we had better
pass over the next day. The evening had come,
and the lamp was resting in a grandfather's chair;
and guess where! Why, at the old watchman's
house. He had begged as a favor that the
mayor and corporation would allow him to keep
the street lamp in consideration of his long and
faithful service, as he had himself hung it up and
lighted it on the day he first commenced his duties,
four and twenty years ago. He looked upon it
almost as his own child. He had no children, so
the lamp was given to him.</p>

<p>There lay the lamp in the great armchair near
the warm stove. It seemed almost to have grown
larger, for it appeared quite to fill the chair. The
old people sat at their supper, casting friendly
glances at it, and would willingly have admitted
it to a place at the table. It is quite true that
they dwelt in a cellar two yards below ground,
and had to cross a stone passage to get to their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
room. But within, it was warm and comfortable,
and strips of list had been nailed round the door.
The bed and the little window had curtains, and
everything looked clean and neat. On the window
seat stood two curious flowerpots, which a sailor
named Christian had brought from the East or
West Indies. They were of clay, and in the form
of two elephants with open backs; they were
filled with earth, and through the open space
flowers bloomed. In one grew some very fine
chives or leeks; this was the kitchen garden. The
other, which contained a beautiful geranium, they
called their flower garden. On the wall hung a
large colored print, representing the Congress of
Vienna and all the kings and emperors. A clock
with heavy weights hung on the wall and went
"tick, tick," steadily enough; yet it was always
rather too fast, which, however, the old people
said was better than being too slow. They were
now eating their supper, while the old street lamp,
as we have heard, lay in the grandfather's armchair
near the stove.</p>

<p>It seemed to the lamp as if the whole world
had turned round. But after a while the old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
watchman looked at the lamp and spoke of what
they had both gone through together&mdash;in rain
and in fog, during the short, bright nights of
summer or in the long winter nights, through
the drifting snowstorms when he longed to be
at home in the cellar. Then the lamp felt that
all was well again. It saw everything that had
happened quite clearly, as if the events were
passing before it. Surely the wind had given it
an excellent gift!</p>

<p>The old people were very active and industrious;
they were never idle for even a single hour.
On Sunday afternoons they would bring out
some books, generally a book of travels which
they greatly liked. The old man would read
aloud about Africa, with its great forests and
the wild elephants, while his wife would listen
attentively, stealing a glance now and then at the
clay elephants which served as flowerpots. "I can
almost imagine I am seeing it all," she said.</p>

<p>Ah! how the lamp wished for a wax taper to
be lighted in it, for then the old woman would
have seen the smallest detail as clearly as it
did itself; the lofty trees, with their thickly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
entwined branches, the naked negroes on horseback,
and whole herds of elephants treading
down bamboo thickets with their broad, heavy
feet.</p>

<p>"What is the use of all my capabilities," sighed
the old lamp, "when I cannot obtain any wax
lights? They have only oil and tallow here, and
these will not do." One day a great heap of
wax-candle ends found their way into the cellar.
The larger pieces were burned, and the smaller
ones the old woman kept for waxing her thread.
So there were now candles enough, but it never
occurred to any one to put a little piece in the
lamp.</p>

<p>"Here I am now, with my rare powers,"
thought the lamp. "I have faculties within me,
but I cannot share them. They do not know that
I could cover these white walls with beautiful
tapestry, or change them into noble forests or,
indeed, to anything else they might wish."</p>

<p>The lamp, however, was always kept clean and
shining in a corner, where it attracted all eyes.
Strangers looked upon it as lumber, but the old
people did not care for that; they loved it. One<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
day&mdash;it was the watchman's birthday&mdash;the old
woman approached the lamp, smiling to herself,
and said, "I will have an illumination to-day, in
honor of my old man." The lamp rattled in its
metal frame, for it thought, "Now at last I shall
have a light within me." But, after all, no wax
light was placed in the lamp&mdash;only oil, as usual.</p>

<p>The lamp burned through the whole evening
and began to perceive too clearly that the gift
of the stars would remain a hidden treasure all
its life. Then it had a dream; for to one with its
faculties, dreaming was not difficult. It dreamed
that the old people were dead and that it had
been taken to the iron foundry to be melted
down. This caused the lamp quite as much
anxiety as on the day when it had been called
upon to appear before the mayor and the council
at the town hall. But though it had been endowed
with the power of falling into decay from
rust when it pleased, it did not make use of this
power. It was therefore put into the melting
furnace and changed into as elegant an iron
candlestick as you could wish to see&mdash;one intended
to hold a wax taper. The candlestick was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
in the form of an angel holding a nosegay, in
the center of which the wax taper was to be
placed. It was to stand on a green writing table
in a very pleasant room, where there were many
books scattered about and splendid paintings on
the walls.</p>

<p>The owner of the room was a poet and a man
of intellect. Everything he thought or wrote was
pictured around him. Nature showed herself to
him sometimes in the dark forests, sometimes in
cheerful meadows where the storks were strutting
about, or on the deck of a ship sailing across the
foaming sea, with the clear, blue sky above, or
at night in the glittering stars.</p>

<p>"What powers I possess!" said the lamp, awaking
from its dream. "I could almost wish to be
melted down; but no, that must not be while
the old people live. They love me for myself
alone; they keep me bright and supply me with
oil. I am as well off as the picture of the Congress,
in which they take so much pleasure."
And from that time it felt at rest in itself, and
not more so than such an honorable old lamp
really deserved to be.</p>

<h2>THE SHEPHERDESS AND THE CHIMNEY SWEEP</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 97px;">
<img src="images/drop-h.png" width="97" height="100" alt="H" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'>AVE you ever seen an old wooden
cabinet, quite worn black with age, and
ornamented with all sorts of carved
figures and flourishes?</div>

<p>Just such a one stood in a certain parlor. It
was a legacy from the great-grandmother, and was
covered from top to bottom with carved roses and
tulips. The most curious flourishes were on it,
too; and between them peered forth little stags'
heads, with their zigzag antlers. On the door
panel had been carved the entire figure of a man,
a most ridiculous man to look at, for he grinned&mdash;you
could not call it smiling or laughing&mdash;in
the drollest way. Moreover, he had crooked legs,
little horns upon his forehead, and a long beard.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>The children used to call him the "crooked-legged
field-marshal-major-general-corporal-sergeant,"
which was a long, hard name to pronounce.
Very few there are, whether in wood or in stone,
who could get such a title. Surely to have cut him
out in wood was no trifling task. However, there
he was. His eyes were always fixed upon the table
below, and toward the mirror, for upon this table
stood a charming little porcelain shepherdess, her
mantle gathered gracefully about her and fastened
with a red rose. Her shoes and hat were gilded,
and her hand held a shepherd's crook; she was
very lovely. Close by her stood a little chimney
sweep, also of porcelain. He was as clean and
neat as any other figure. Indeed, he might as
well have been made a prince as a sweep, since
he was only make-believe; for though everywhere
else he was as black as a coal, his round, bright
face was as fresh and rosy as a girl's. This was
certainly a mistake&mdash;it ought to have been black.</p>

<p>There he stood so prettily, with his ladder in
his hand, quite close to the shepherdess. From
the first he had been placed there, and he always
remained on the same spot; for they had promised<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
to be true to each other. They suited each other
exactly&mdash;they were both young, both of the same
kind of porcelain, and both equally fragile.</p>

<p>Close to them stood another figure three times
as large as themselves. It was an old Chinaman,
a mandarin, who could nod his head. He was of
porcelain, too, and he said he was the grandfather
of the shepherdess; but this he could not prove.
He insisted that he had authority over her, and
so when the crooked-legged
field-marshal-major-general-corporal-sergeant
made proposals to the
little shepherdess, he nodded his head, in token
of his consent.</p>

<p>"You will have a husband," said the old mandarin
to her, "a husband who, I verily believe, is
of mahogany wood. You will be the wife of a
field-marshal-major-general-corporal-sergeant, of a
man who has a whole cabinet full of silver plate,
besides a store of no one knows what in the secret
drawers."</p>

<p>"I will never go into that dismal cabinet," declared
the little shepherdess. "I have heard it
said that there are eleven porcelain ladies already
imprisoned there."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then," rejoined the mandarin, "you will be
the twelfth, and you will be in good company.
This very night, when the old cabinet creaks, we
shall keep the wedding, as surely as I am a Chinese
mandarin." And upon this he nodded his
head and fell asleep.</p>

<p>But the little shepherdess wept, and turned to
the beloved of her heart, the porcelain chimney
sweep.</p>

<p>"I believe I must ask you," she said, "to go
out with me into the wide world, for here it is
not possible for us to stay."</p>

<p>"I will do in everything as you wish," replied
the little chimney sweep. "Let us go at once. I
am sure I can support you by my trade."</p>

<p>"If we were only down from the table," said
she. "I shall not feel safe till we are far away
out in the wide world and free."</p>

<p>The little chimney sweep comforted her, and
showed her how to set her little foot on the carved
edges, and on the gilded foliage twining round the
leg of the table, till at last they both reached the
floor. But, turning for a last look at the old cabinet,
they saw that everything was in commotion.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
All the carved stags stretched their heads farther
out than before, raised their antlers, and moved
their throats, while the crooked-legged field-marshal-major-general-corporal-sergeant
sprang
up and shouted to the old Chinese mandarin,
"Look! they are eloping! they are eloping!"</p>

<p>They were not a little frightened at this, and
jumped quickly into an open drawer in the
window seat.</p>

<p>Here lay three or four packs of cards that were
not quite complete, and a little doll's theater,
which had been set up as nicely as could be.
A play was going on, and all the queens sat in
the front row, and fanned themselves with the
flowers which they held in their hands, while
behind them stood the knaves, each with two
heads, one above and one below, as playing cards
have. The play was about two persons who were
not allowed to marry, and the shepherdess cried,
for it seemed so like her own story.</p>

<p>"I cannot bear this!" she said. "Let us leave
the drawer."</p>

<p>But when she had again reached the floor she
looked up at the table and saw that the old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
Chinese mandarin was awake, and that he was
rocking his whole body to and fro with rage.</p>

<p>"The old mandarin is coming!" cried she, and
down she fell on her porcelain knees, so frightened
was she.</p>

<p>"I have thought of a plan," said the chimney
sweep. "Suppose we creep into the jar of perfumes,
the potpourri vase which stands in the
corner. There we can rest upon roses and lavender,
and throw salt in his eyes if he comes near."</p>

<p>"That will not do at all," she said. "Besides,
I know that the old mandarin and the potpourri
vase were once betrothed; and no doubt some
slight friendship still exists between them. No,
there is no help for it; we must wander forth
together into the wide world."</p>

<p>"Have you really the courage to go out into
the wide world with me?" asked the chimney
sweep. "Have you considered how large it is,
and that if we go, we can never come back?"</p>

<p>"I have," replied she.</p>

<p>And the chimney sweep looked earnestly at
her and said, "My way lies through the chimney.
Have you really the courage to go with me<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
through the stove, and creep through the flues
and the tunnel? Well do I know the way! we
shall come out by the chimney, and then I shall
know how to manage. We shall mount so high
that they can never reach us, and at the top there
is an opening that leads out into the wide world."</p>

<p>And he led her to the door of the stove.</p>

<p>"Oh, how black it looks!" she said. Still she
went on with him, through the stove, the flues,
and the tunnel, where it was as dark as pitch.</p>

<p>"Now we are in the chimney," said he; "and
see what a lovely star shines above us."</p>

<p>There actually was a star in the sky, that was
shining right down upon them, as if to show
them the way. Now they climbed and crept&mdash;a
frightful way it was, so steep and high! But
he went first to guide, and to smooth the way as
much as he could. He showed her the best
places on which to set her little china foot, till
at last they came to the edge of the chimney and
sat down to rest, for they were very tired, as may
well be supposed.</p>

<p>The sky and all its stars were above them,
and below lay all the roofs of the town. They<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
saw all around them the great, wide world. It
was not like what the poor little shepherdess
had fancied it, and she leaned her little head
upon her chimney sweep's shoulder and wept
so bitterly that the gilding was washed from
her golden sash.</p>

<p>"This is too much," said she; "it is more than
I can bear. The world is too large! I wish I
were safe back again upon the little table under
the mirror. I shall never be happy till I am there
once more. I have followed you out into the
wide world. Surely, if you really love me, you
will follow me back."</p>

<p>The chimney sweep tried to reason with her.
He reminded her of the old mandarin, and the
crooked-legged field-marshal-major-general-corporal-sergeant,
but she wept so bitterly, and kissed
her little chimney sweep so fondly, that he could not
do otherwise than as she wished, foolish as it was.</p>

<p>So they climbed down the chimney, though
with the greatest difficulty, crept through the
flues, and into the stove, where they paused to
listen behind the door, to discover what might be
going on in the room.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>All was quiet, and they peeped out. Alas!
there on the floor lay the old mandarin. He had
fallen from the table in his attempt to follow the
runaways, and had broken into three pieces. His
whole back had come off in a single piece, and
his head had rolled into a corner. The crooked-legged
field-marshal-major-general-corporal-sergeant
stood where he had always stood, reflecting
upon what had happened.</p>

<p>"This is shocking!" said the little shepherdess.
"My old grandfather is broken in pieces, and we
are the cause of it," and she wrung her little
hands.</p>

<p>"He can be riveted," said the chimney sweep;
"he can certainly be riveted. Do not grieve so!
If they cement his back and put a rivet through
his neck, he will be just as good as new, and will
be able to say as many disagreeable things to us
as ever."</p>

<p>"Do you really think so?" asked she. Then
they climbed again up to the place where they
had stood before.</p>

<p>"How far we have been," observed the chimney
sweep, "and since we have got no farther<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
than this, we might have saved ourselves all the
trouble."</p>

<p>"I wish grandfather were mended," said the
shepherdess; "I wonder if it will cost very
much."</p>

<p>Mended he was. The family had his back
cemented and his neck riveted, so that he was
as good as new, only he could not nod.</p>

<p>"You have become proud since you were
broken to shivers," observed the crooked-legged
field-marshal-major-general-corporal-sergeant,
"but I must say, for my part, I don't see much
to be proud of. Am I to have her, or am I not?
Just answer me that."</p>

<p>The chimney sweep and the shepherdess looked
most piteously at the old mandarin. They were
so afraid that he would nod his head. But he
could not, and it would have been beneath his
dignity to have confessed to having a rivet in
his neck. So the young porcelain people always
remained together, and they blessed the grandfather's
rivet and loved each other till they were
broken in pieces.</p>

<h2>THE DROP OF WATER</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 105px;">
<img src="images/drop-y.png" width="105" height="100" alt="Y" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'>OU know, surely, what the microscope is&mdash;that
wonderful little glass which makes
everything appear a hundred times larger
than it really is.</div>

<p>If you look through a microscope at a single
drop of ditch water, you will see a thousand odd-looking
creatures, such as you never could imagine
dwelled in water. They do not look unlike
a whole plateful of shrimps, all jumping and
crowding upon each other. So fierce are these
little creatures that they will tear off each other's
arms and legs without the least mercy, and yet
after their fashion they look merry and happy.</p>

<p>Now there was once an old man, whom his
neighbors called Cribbley Crabbley&mdash;a curious
name, to be sure, which meant something like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
"creep-and-crawl." He always liked to make the
most of everything, and when he could not manage
it in the ordinary way, he tried magic.</p>

<p>One day he sat looking through his microscope
at a drop of water that had been brought from a
neighboring ditch. What a scene of scrambling
and swarming it was, to be sure! All the thousands
of little imps in the water jumped and
sprang about, devouring each other, or tearing
each other to bits.</p>

<p>"Upon my word this is really shocking. There
must surely be some way to make them live in
peace and quiet, so that each attends only to his
own concerns." And he thought and thought, but
still could not hit upon any plan, so he must
needs have recourse to conjuring.</p>

<p>"I must give them color so that they may be
seen more plainly," said he. Accordingly he
poured something that looked like a drop of red
wine&mdash;but which in reality was witch's blood&mdash;upon
the drop of water. Immediately all the
strange little creatures became red all over, and
looked for all the world like a whole town full of
naked red Indians.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, what have you here?" asked another old
magician, who had no name at all, which made him
even more remarkable than Cribbley Crabbley.</p>

<p>"If you can find out what it is," replied Cribbley
Crabbley, "I will give it you; but I warn you
you'll not do so easily."</p>

<p>The conjurer without a name looked through
the microscope, and it seemed to him that the
scene before him was a whole town, in which the
people ran about naked in the wildest way. It
was quite shocking! Still more horrible was it to
see how they kicked and cuffed, struggled and
fought, pecked, bit, tore, and swallowed, each his
neighbor. Those that were under wanted to be at
the top, while those that chanced to be at the top
must needs thrust themselves underneath.</p>

<p>"And now look, his leg is longer than mine, so
off with it!" one seemed to be saying. Another
had a little lump behind his ear,&mdash;an innocent
little lump enough,&mdash;but it seemed to pain him,
and therefore the others seemed determined that
it should pain him more. So they hacked at it,
and dragged the poor thing about, and at last ate
him up, all on account of the little lump. One<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
only of the creatures was quiet, a modest little
maid, who sat by herself evidently wishing for
nothing but peace and quietness. The others
would not have it so, however. They soon pulled
the little damsel forward, cuffed and tore her, and
then ate her up.</p>

<p>"This is uncommonly droll and amusing!" said
the nameless magician.</p>

<p>"Yes. But what do you think it is?" asked
Cribbley Crabbley. "Can you make it out?"</p>

<p>"It is easy enough to guess, to be sure," was
the reply of the nameless magician; "easy enough.
It is either Paris or Copenhagen, or some other
great city; I don't know which, for they are all
alike. It is some great city, of course."</p>

<p>"It is a drop of ditch-water," said Cribbley
Crabbley.</p>

<h2>THE SWINEHERD</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 83px;">
<img src="images/drop-t.png" width="83" height="100" alt="T" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'>HERE was once a poor prince who had
a kingdom, but it was a very small one.
Still it was quite large enough to admit
of his marrying, and he wished to marry.</div>

<p>It was certainly rather bold of him to say,
as he did, to the emperor's daughter, "Will
you have me?" But he was renowned far and
wide, and there were a hundred princesses who
would have answered, "Yes," and, "Thank you
kindly." We shall see what this princess said.
Listen!</p>

<p>It happened that where the prince's father lay
buried there grew a rose tree, a most beautiful
rose tree, which blossomed only once in five
years, and even then bore only one flower. Ah,
but that was a rose! It smelled so sweet that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
all cares and sorrows were forgotten by those
who inhaled its fragrance!</p>

<p>Moreover, the prince had a nightingale that
could sing in such a manner that it seemed as
if all sweet melodies dwelt in her little throat.
Now the princess was to have the rose and the
nightingale; and they were accordingly put into
large silver caskets and sent to her.</p>

<p>The emperor had them brought into a large
hall, where the princess and the ladies of the
court were playing at "Visiting." When she
saw the caskets with the presents, the princess
clapped her hands for joy.</p>

<p>"Ah, if it should be a little pussy cat," exclaimed
she. Instead, the rose tree, with its beautiful
rose, came to view.</p>

<p>"Oh, how prettily it is made!" said all the
court ladies.</p>

<p>"It is more than pretty," said the emperor;
"it is charming."</p>

<p>The princess touched it and was ready to cry.
"Fie, papa," said she, "it is not made at all. It is
natural!"</p>

<p>"Fie," said all the court ladies; "it is natural!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let us see what the other casket contains
before we get into bad humor," proposed the
emperor. So the nightingale came forth, and
sang so delightfully that at first no one could
say anything ill-humored of her.</p>

<p>"<i>Superbe! charmant!</i>" exclaimed the ladies,
for they all used to chatter French, and each
worse than her neighbor.</p>

<p>"How much the bird reminds me of the musical
box that belonged to our blessed empress!"
remarked an old knight. "Oh! yes, these are the
same tunes, the same execution."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes!" said the emperor, and at the remembrance
he wept like a child.</p>

<p>"I still hope it is not a real bird," said the
princess.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is a real bird," said those who had
brought it.</p>

<p>"Well, then, let the bird fly," returned the princess.
And she positively refused to see the prince.</p>

<p>However, he was not to be discouraged. He
stained his face brown and black, pulled his cap
over his ears, and knocked at the door of the
castle.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>"Good day to my lord the emperor," said he.
"Can I have employment here at the palace?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes," said the emperor. "It just occurs
to me that I want some one to take care of the
pigs, there are so many of them."</p>

<p>So the prince came to be the imperial swineherd.</p>

<p>He had a miserable little room, close by the
pigsty, and here he was obliged to stay; and
he sat the whole day long and worked. By
evening he had made a pretty little saucepan.
Little bells were hung all around it; and when
the pot was boiling, the bells tinkled in the most
charming manner, and played the old melody,</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Ach, du lieber Augustin,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Alles ist weg, weg, weg."</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>But what was still more curious, whoever held
his finger in the smoke of this saucepan, at once
smelled all the dishes that were cooking on every
hearth of the city. This, you see, was something
quite different from the rose.</div>

<p>Now the princess happened to walk that way
with her court ladies, and when she heard the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
tune she stood quite still and seemed pleased,
for she could play "Dearest Augustine." It was
the only piece she knew, and she played it with
one finger.</p>

<p>"Why, that is the piece that I play on the
piano!" said the princess. "That swineherd must
certainly have been well educated. Go in and
ask him the price of the instrument."</p>

<p>So one of the court ladies had to go in, but she
drew on wooden slippers first.</p>

<p>"What will you take for the saucepan?" inquired
the lady.</p>

<p>"I must have ten kisses from the princess,"
said the swineherd.</p>

<p>"Heaven preserve us!" exclaimed the maid
of honor.</p>

<p>"I cannot sell it for less," answered the swineherd.</p>

<p>"Well, what does he say?" asked the princess.</p>

<p>"I cannot tell you, really," replied the lady.
"It is too dreadful."</p>

<p>"Then you may whisper it." So the lady
whispered it.</p>

<p>"He is an impudent fellow," said the princess,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
and she walked on. But when she had gone a
little way, the bells again tinkled prettily,</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Ah! thou dearest Augustine,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">All is gone, gone, gone."</span><br />
</div>

<p>"Stay!" said the princess. "Ask him if he will
have ten kisses from the ladies of my court."</p>

<p>"No, thank you!" answered the swineherd.
"Ten kisses from the princess, or I keep the
saucepan myself."</p>

<p>"How tiresome! That must not be either!"
said the princess; "but do you all stand before
me, that no one may see us."</p>

<p>The court ladies placed themselves in front
of her, and spread out their dresses. So the
swineherd got ten kisses, and the princess got
the saucepan.</p>

<p>That was delightful! The saucepan was kept
boiling all the evening and the whole of the following
day. They knew perfectly well what was
cooking on every hearth in the city, from the
chamberlain's to the cobbler's. The court ladies
danced and clapped their hands.</p>

<p>"We know who has soup, and who has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
pancakes for dinner to-day; who has cutlets, and
who has eggs. How interesting!"</p>

<p>"Yes, but keep my secret, for I am an emperor's
daughter."</p>

<p>The prince&mdash;that is, the swineherd, for no one
knew that he was other than an ill-favored swineherd&mdash;let
not a day pass without working at
something. At last he constructed a rattle, which,
when it was swung round and round, played all
the waltzes and jig tunes which have been heard
since the creation of the world.</p>

<p>"Ah, that is <i>superbe!</i>" said the princess, when
she passed by. "I have never heard prettier compositions.
Go in and ask him the price of the instrument.
But mind, he shall have no more kisses."</p>

<p>"He will have a hundred kisses from the
princess," said the lady who had been to ask.</p>

<p>"He is not in his right senses," said the
princess, and walked on. But when she had
gone a little way she stopped again. "One must
encourage art," said she; "I am the emperor's
daughter. Tell him he shall, as on yesterday,
have ten kisses from me, and may take the rest
from the ladies of the court."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, but we should not like that at all," said
the ladies.</p>

<p>"What are you muttering?" asked the princess.
"If I can kiss him, surely you can! Remember I
give you food and wages."</p>

<p>"A hundred kisses from the princess," said he,
"or else let every one keep his own."</p>

<p>"Stand round," said she, and all the ladies stood
round as before.</p>

<p>"What can be the reason for such a crowd close
by the pigsty?" asked the emperor, who happened
just then to step out on the balcony. He rubbed
his eyes and put on his spectacles.</p>

<p>"They are the ladies of the court. I must go
and see what they are about." So he pulled up his
slippers at the heel, for he had trodden them down.</p>

<p>As soon as he had got into the courtyard he
moved very softly, and the ladies were so much
engrossed with counting the kisses that they did
not perceive the emperor. He rose on his tiptoes.</p>

<p>"What is all this?" said he, when he saw what
was going on, and he boxed the princess's ear
with his slipper, just as the swineherd was taking
the eighty-sixth kiss.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>"Be off with you! March out!" cried the
emperor, for he was very angry. Both princess
and swineherd were thrust out of the city, and the
princess stood and wept, while the swineherd
scolded, and the rain poured down.</p>

<p>"Alas, unhappy creature that I am!" said the
princess. "If I had but married the handsome
young prince! Ah, how unfortunate I am!"</p>

<p>The swineherd went behind a tree, washed the
black and brown from his face, threw off his dirty
clothing, and stepped forth in his princely robes.
He looked so noble that the princess could not
help bowing before him.</p>

<p>"I have come to despise thee," said he. "Thou
wouldst not have an honorable prince! Thou
couldst not prize the rose and the nightingale, but
thou wast ready to kiss the swineherd for the sake
of a trumpery plaything. Thou art rightly served."</p>

<p>He then went back to his own little kingdom,
where he shut the door of his palace before her
very eyes. Now she might well sing,</p>

<h2>THE METAL PIG</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 38px;">
<img src="images/drop-i.png" width="38" height="100" alt="I" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'>N THE city of Florence, not far from the
Piazza del Granduca, runs a little cross street
called Porta Rosa. In this street, just in front
of the market place where vegetables are sold,
stands a pig, made of brass and curiously formed.
The color has been changed by age to dark green,
but clear, fresh water pours from the snout, which
shines as if it had been polished&mdash;and so indeed
it has, for hundreds of poor people and children
seize it in their hands as they place their mouths
close to the mouth of the animal to drink. It
is quite a picture to see a half-naked boy clasping
the well-formed creature by the head as he
presses his rosy lips against its jaws. Every
one who visits Florence can very quickly find
the place; he has only to ask the first beggar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
he meets for the Metal Pig, and he will be told
where it is.</div>

<p>It was late on a winter evening. The mountains
were covered with snow, but the moon shone
brightly, and moonlight in Italy is as good as the
light of gray winter's day in the north. Indeed, it
is better, for the clear air seems to raise us above
the earth; while in the north a cold, gray, leaden
sky appears to press us down to earth, even as
the cold, damp earth shall one day press on us in
the grave.</p>

<p>In the garden of the grand duke's palace, under
the roof of one of the wings, where a thousand
roses bloom in winter, a little ragged boy had
been sitting the whole day long. The boy might
serve as a type of Italy: lovely and smiling, and
yet suffering. He was hungry and thirsty, but no
one gave him anything; and when it became
dark and they were about to close the gardens,
the porter turned him out. A long time he stood
musing on the bridge which crosses the Arno
and looking at the glittering stars that were
reflected in the water which flowed between him
and the wonderful marble bridge Delia Trinit&agrave;.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
He then walked away towards the Metal Pig, half
knelt down, clasped it with his arms, and, putting
his mouth to the shining snout, drank deep
draughts of the fresh water. Close by lay a few
salad leaves and two chestnuts, which were to
serve for his supper. No one was in the street
but himself. It belonged only to him. He boldly
seated himself on the pig's back, leaned forward
so that his curly head could rest on the head of
the animal, and, before he was aware, fell asleep.</p>

<p>It was midnight. The Metal Pig raised himself
gently, and the boy heard him say quite distinctly,
"Hold tight, little boy, for I am going to
run"; and away he started for a most wonderful
ride. First they arrived at the Piazza del Granduca,
and the metal horse which bears the duke's
statue neighed aloud. The painted coats of arms
on the old council house shone like transparent
pictures, and Michelangelo's "David" swung his
sling. It was as if everything had life. The metallic
groups of figures, among which were "Perseus"
and "The Rape of the Sabines," looked like
living persons, and cries of terror sounded from
them all across the noble square. By the Palazzo<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
degli Uffizi, in the arcade where the nobility assembled
for the carnival, the Metal Pig stopped.
"Hold fast," said the animal, "hold fast, for I
am going upstairs."</p>

<p>The little boy said not a word. He was half
pleased and half afraid. They entered a long gallery,
where the boy had been before. The walls
were resplendent with paintings, and here and
there stood statues and busts, all in a clear light
as if it were day. The grandest sight appeared
when the door of a side room opened. The little
boy could remember what beautiful things he
had seen there, but to-night everything shone in
its brightest colors. Here stood the figure of a
beautiful woman, as radiantly beautiful as nature
and the art of one of the great masters could
make her. Her graceful limbs appeared to move;
dolphins sprang at her feet, and immortality
shone from her eyes. The world called her the
"Venus de' Medici." By her side were statues of
stone, in which the spirit of life breathed; figures
of men, one of whom whetted his sword and was
named "The Grinder"; fighting gladiators, for
whom the sword had been sharpened, and who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
strove for the goddess of beauty. The boy was
dazzled by so much glitter, for the walls were
gleaming with bright colors. Life and movement
were in everything.</p>

<p>As they passed from hall to hall, beauty showed
itself in whatever they saw; and, as the Metal
Pig went step by step from one picture to another,
the little boy could see it all plainly. One
glory eclipsed another; yet there was one picture
that fixed itself on the little boy's memory more
especially, because of the happy children it represented;
for these the little boy had seen in daylight.
Many pass this picture with indifference,
and yet it contains a treasure of poetic feeling.
It represents Christ descending into Hades. It
is not those who are lost that one sees, but the
heathen of olden times.</p>

<p>The Florentine, Angiolo Bronzino, painted this
picture. Most beautiful is the expression on the
faces of two children who appear to have full
confidence that they shall reach heaven at last.
They are embracing each other, and one little
one stretches out his hand towards another who
stands below them, and points to himself as if he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
were saying, "I am going to heaven." The older
people stand as if uncertain yet hopeful, and bow
in humble adoration to the Lord Jesus. On this
picture the boy's eyes rested longer than on any
other, and the Metal Pig stood still before it. A
low sigh was heard. Did it come from the picture
or from the animal? The boy raised his hands
toward the smiling children, and then the pig
ran off with him through the open vestibule.</p>

<p>"Thank you, thank you, you beautiful animal,"
said the little boy, caressing the Metal Pig as it
ran down the steps.</p>

<p>"Thanks to yourself also," replied the Metal
Pig. "I have helped you and you have helped
me, for it is only when I have an innocent child
on my back that I receive the power to run.
Yes, as you see, I can even venture under the
rays of the lamp in front of the picture of the
Madonna, but I must not enter the church. Still,
from without, and while you are upon my back,
I may look in through the open door. Do not
get down yet, for if you do, then I shall be lifeless,
as you have seen me in the daytime in the
Porta Rosa."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>"I will stay with you, my dear creature," said
the little boy. So they went on at a rapid pace
through the streets of Florence, till they came
to the square before the church of Santa Croce.
The folding doors flew open, and lights streamed
from the altar, through the church, into the deserted
square. A wonderful blaze of light streamed
from one of the monuments in the left aisle, and
a thousand moving stars formed a kind of glory
round it. Even the coat of arms on the tombstone
shone, and a red ladder on a blue field
gleamed like fire. It was the grave of Galileo.
The monument is unadorned, but the red ladder
is an emblem of art&mdash;signifying that the way to
glory leads up a shining ladder, on which the
great prophets rise to heaven like Elijah of old.
In the right aisle of the church every statue on
the richly carved sarcophagi seemed endowed with
life. Here stood Michelangelo; there Dante,
with the laurel wreath around his brow; Alfieri
and Machiavelli; for here, side by side, rest the
great men, the pride of Italy.</p>

<p>The church itself is very beautiful, even more
beautiful than the marble cathedral at Florence,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
though not so large. It seemed as if the carved
vestments stirred, and as if the marble figures
which they covered raised their heads higher
to gaze upon the brightly colored, glowing altar,
where the white-robed boys swung the golden
censers amid music and song; and the strong fragrance
of incense filled the church and streamed
forth into the square. The boy stretched out
his hands toward the light, and at the same
moment the Metal Pig started again, so rapidly
that he was obliged to cling tightly to him. The
wind whistled in his ears. He heard the church
door creak on its hinges as it closed, and it
seemed to him as if he had lost his senses; then
a cold shudder passed over him, and he awoke.</p>

<p>It was morning. The Metal Pig stood in its
old place on the Porta Rosa, and the boy found
that he had nearly slipped off its back. Fear
and trembling came upon him as he thought
of his mother. She had sent him out the day
before to get some money, but he had not been
able to get any, and now he was hungry and
thirsty. Once more he clasped the neck of his
metal steed, kissed its nose, and nodded farewell<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
to it. Then he wandered away into one of the
narrowest streets, where there was scarcely room
for a loaded donkey to pass. A great iron-bound
door stood ajar; and, passing through, he
climbed a brick staircase with dirty walls, and
a rope for balustrade, till he came to an open
gallery hung with rags. From here a flight of
steps led down to a court, where from a fountain
water was drawn up by iron rollers to the
different stories of the house. Many water buckets
hung side by side. Sometimes the roller and the
bucket danced in the air, splashing the water all
over the court. Another broken-down staircase
led from the gallery, and two Russian sailors
running down it almost upset the poor boy.
They were coming from their nightly carousal.
A woman, not very young, with an unpleasant
face and a quantity of black hair, followed them.
"What have you brought home?" she asked
when she saw the boy.</p>

<p>"Don't be angry," he pleaded. "I received
nothing, I have nothing at all"; and he seized
his mother's dress and would have kissed it.
Then they went into a little room. I need not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
describe it, but only say that there stood in it
an earthen pot with handles, made for holding
fire, which in Italy is called a <i>marito</i>. This pot
she took in her lap, warmed her fingers, and
pushed the boy with her elbow.</p>

<p>"Certainly you must have some money," she
said. The boy began to cry, and then she struck
him till he cried aloud.</p>

<p>"Be quiet, or I'll break your screaming head."
She swung about the fire pot which she held in
her hand, while the boy crouched to the earth
and screamed. Then a neighbor came in, who
also had a <i>marito</i> under her arm. "Felicita," she
said, "what are you doing to the child?"</p>

<p>"The child is mine," she answered; "I can
murder him if I like, and you too, Giannina."</p>

<p>Then again she swung the fire pot about. The
other woman lifted hers up to defend herself, and
the two pots clashed so violently that they were
dashed to pieces and fire and ashes flew about
the room.</p>

<p>The boy rushed out at the sight, sped across
the courtyard, and fled from the house. The poor
child ran till he was quite out of breath. At last<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
he stopped at the church the doors of which
were opened to him the night before, and went
in. Here everything was bright, and the boy
knelt down by the first tomb on his right hand,
the grave of Michelangelo, and sobbed as if his
heart would break. People came and went; the
service went on, but no one noticed the boy except
an elderly citizen, who stood still and looked
at him for a moment and then went away like
the rest. Hunger and thirst overpowered the
child, and he became quite faint and ill. At last
he crept into a corner behind the marble monuments
and went to sleep. Towards evening he
was awakened by a pull at his sleeve. He started
up, and the same old citizen stood before him.</p>

<p>"Are you ill? Where do you live? Have you
been here all day?" were some of the questions
asked by the old man. After hearing his answers,
the old man took him to a small house in
a back street close by. They entered a glovemaker's
shop, where a woman sat sewing busily.
A little white poodle, so closely shaved that his
pink skin could plainly be seen, frisked about the
room and gamboled over the boy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>"Innocent souls are soon intimate," said the
woman, as she caressed both the boy and the dog.</p>

<p>These good people gave the child food and
drink, and said he should stay with them all
night, and that the next day the old man, who
was called Giuseppe, would go and speak to his
mother. A simple little bed was prepared for him,
but to him who had so often slept on the hard
stones it was a royal couch, and he slept sweetly
and dreamed of the splendid pictures, and of the
Metal Pig. Giuseppe went out the next morning,
and the poor child was not glad to see him go, for
he knew that the old man had gone to his mother,
and that perhaps he would have to return. He
wept at the thought, and then played with the
lively little dog and kissed it, while the old woman
looked kindly at him to encourage him.</p>

<p>What news did Giuseppe bring back? At first
the boy could not find out, for the old man talked
to his wife, and she nodded and stroked the boy's
cheek. Then she said, "He is a good lad, he
shall stay with us. He may become a clever glovemaker,
like you. Look what delicate fingers he has.
Madonna intended him for a glovemaker."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>So the boy stayed with them, and the woman
herself taught him to sew. He ate well, and slept
well, and became very merry. But at last he
began to tease Bellissima, as the little dog was
called. This made the woman angry, and she
scolded him and threatened him, which made him
unhappy, and he went and sat in his own room,
full of sad thoughts. This chamber looked out
upon the street, in which hung skins to dry, and
there were thick iron bars across his window.
That night he lay awake, thinking of the Metal
Pig. Indeed, it was always in his thoughts. Suddenly
he fancied he heard feet outside going pitapat.
He sprang out of bed and went to the
window. Could it be the Metal Pig? But there
was nothing to be seen. Whatever he had heard
had passed already.</p>

<p>"Go help the gentleman to carry his box of
colors," said the woman the next morning when
their neighbor, the artist, passed by, carrying a
paint box and a large roll of canvas. The boy
instantly took the box and followed the painter.
They walked on till they reached the picture
gallery, and mounted the same staircase up which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
he had ridden that night on the Metal Pig. He
remembered all the pictures and statues, especially
the marble Venus, and again he looked at
the Madonna with the Saviour and St. John.
They stopped before the picture by Il Bronzino,
in which Christ is represented as standing in the
lower world, with the children smiling before him
in the sweet expectation of entering heaven. The
poor boy smiled, too, for here was his heaven.</p>

<p>"You may go home now," said the painter,
while the boy stood watching him till he had
set up his easel.</p>

<p>"May I see you paint?" asked the boy. "May
I see you put the picture on this white canvas?"</p>

<p>"I am not going to paint," replied the artist,
bringing out a piece of chalk. His hand moved
quickly, and his eye measured the great picture,
and though nothing appeared but a faint line, the
figure of the Saviour was as clearly visible as in
the colored picture.</p>

<p>"Why don't you go?" said the painter. Then
the boy wandered home silently, and seated himself
on the table, and learned to sew gloves. But
all day long his thoughts were in the picture<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
gallery, and so he pricked his fingers and was
awkward. But he did not tease Bellissima. When
evening came, and the house door stood open, he
slipped out. It was a bright, beautiful, starlight
evening, but rather cold. Away he went through
the already deserted streets, and soon came to
the Metal Pig. He stooped down and kissed its
shining nose, and then seated himself on its back.</p>

<p>"You happy creature," he said; "how I have
longed for you! We must take a ride to-night."</p>

<p>But the Metal Pig lay motionless, while the
fresh stream gushed forth from its mouth. The
little boy still sat astride its back, when he felt
something pulling at his clothes. He looked
down, and there was Bellissima, little smooth-shaven
Bellissima, barking as if she would have
said, "Here I am, too. Why are you sitting
there?"</p>

<p>A fiery dragon could not have frightened the
little boy so much as did the little dog in this
place. Bellissima in the street and not dressed!
as the old lady called it. What would be the
end of this? The dog never went out in winter,
unless she was attired in a little lambskin coat,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
which had been made for her. It was fastened
round the little dog's neck and body with red
ribbons, and decorated with rosettes and little
bells. The dog looked almost like a little kid
when she was allowed to go out in winter and
trot after her mistress. Now, here she was in the
cold, and not dressed. Oh, how would it end? All
his fancies were quickly put to flight; yet he
kissed the Metal Pig once more, and then took
Bellissima in his arms. The poor little thing
trembled so with cold that the boy ran homeward
as fast as he could.</p>

<p>"What are you running away with there?"
asked two of the police whom he met, and at
whom the dog barked. "Where have you stolen
that pretty dog?" they asked, and took it away
from him.</p>

<p>"Oh, I have not stolen it. Do give it back to
me," cried the boy, despairingly.</p>

<p>"If you have not stolen it, you may say at
home that they can send to the watch-house for
the dog." Then they told him where the watch-house
was, and went away with Bellissima.</p>

<p>Here was trouble indeed. The boy did not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
know whether he had better jump into the Arno
or go home and confess everything. They would
certainly kill him, he thought.</p>

<p>"Well, I would gladly be killed," he reasoned;
"for then I should die and go to heaven." And
so he went home, almost hoping for death.</p>

<p>The door was locked, and he could not reach
the knocker. No one was in the street, so he
took up a stone and with it made a tremendous
noise at the door.</p>

<p>"Who is there?" asked somebody from within.</p>

<p>"It is I," said he. "Bellissima is gone. Open
the door, and then kill me."</p>

<p>Then, indeed, there was a great panic, for
madam was so very fond of Bellissima. She immediately
looked at the wall where the dog's dress
usually hung; and there was the little lambskin.</p>

<p>"Bellissima in the watch-house!" she cried.
"You bad boy! How did you entice her out?
Poor little delicate thing, with those rough policemen!
And she'll be frozen with cold."</p>

<p>Giuseppe went off at once, while his wife
lamented and the boy wept. Several of the
neighbors came in, and among them the painter.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
He took the boy between his knees and questioned
him. Soon he heard the whole story, told
in broken sentences, and also about the Metal
Pig and the wonderful ride to the picture gallery,
which was certainly rather incomprehensible.
The painter, however, consoled the little
fellow, and tried to soften the woman's anger,
but she would not be pacified till her husband
returned from the police with Bellissima. Then
there was great rejoicing, and the painter caressed
the boy and gave him a number of pictures.</p>

<p>Oh, what beautiful pictures those were&mdash;figures
with funny heads! And, best of all, the
Metal Pig was there, too. Nothing could be
more delightful! By means of a few strokes it
was made to appear on the paper; and even the
house that stood behind it had been sketched.
Oh, if he could only draw and paint! He who
could do this could conjure all the world before
him. The first leisure moment during the next
day the boy got a pencil, and on the back of one
of the other drawings he attempted to copy the
drawing of the Metal Pig, and he succeeded.
Certainly it was rather crooked, rather up and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
down, one leg thick, and another thin. Still it
was like the copy, and he was overjoyed at what
he had done. The pencil would not go quite as
it ought, he had found, but the next day he tried
again. A second pig was drawn by the side of
the first, and this looked a hundred times better.
The third attempt was so good that everybody
could see what it was meant to represent.</p>

<p>And now the glovemaking went on but slowly.
The orders given by the shops in the town were
not finished quickly; for the Metal Pig had
taught the boy that all objects may be drawn
upon paper, and Florence is a picture book in
itself for any one who chooses to turn over its
pages. On the Piazza della Trinit&agrave; stands a
slender pillar, and upon it is the goddess of
justice blindfolded, with her scales in her hand.
She was soon represented on paper, and it was
the glovemaker's boy who placed her there. His
collection of pictures increased, but as yet they
were only copies of lifeless objects, when one day
Bellissima came gamboling before him. "Stand
still," cried he, "and I will draw you beautifully,
to put in my collection."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>Bellissima would not stand still, so she must be
bound fast in one position. He tied her head and
tail, but she barked and jumped and so pulled
and tightened the string that she was nearly
strangled. And just then her mistress walked in.</p>

<p>"You wicked boy! The poor little creature!"
was all she could utter.</p>

<p>She pushed the boy from her, thrust him away
with her foot, called him a most ungrateful, good-for-nothing,
wicked boy, and forbade him to enter
her house again. Then she wept, and kissed her
little half-strangled Bellissima. At this moment
the painter entered the room&mdash;and here is the
turning point of the story.</p>

<p>In the year 1834 there was an exhibition in
the Academy of Arts at Florence. Two pictures,
placed side by side, attracted many people. The
smaller of the two represented a little boy sitting
at a table drawing. Before him was a little white
poodle, curiously shaven, but as the animal would
not stand still, its head and tail had been fastened
with a string, to keep it in one position. The
truthfulness and life in this picture interested
every one. The painter was said to be a young<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
Florentine, who had been found in the streets
when a child by an old glovemaker, who had
brought him up. The boy had taught himself to
draw. It was also said that a young artist, now
famous, had discovered this talent in the child just
as he was about to be sent away for having tied
up madam's favorite little dog to use as a model.</p>

<p>The glovemaker's boy had become a really great
painter, as the picture proved; but the larger
picture by its side was a still greater proof of
his talent. It represented a handsome boy asleep,
clothed in rags and leaning against the Metal
Pig, in the street of the Porta Rosa. All the
spectators knew the spot well. The child's arms
were round the neck of the Pig, and he was in
a deep sleep. The lamp before the picture of
the Madonna threw a strong light on the pale,
delicate face of the child. It was a beautiful
picture. A large gilt frame surrounded it, and
on one corner of the frame a laurel wreath had
been hung. But a black band, twined unseen
among the green leaves, and a streamer of crape
hung down from it; for within the last few days
the young artist had&mdash;died.</p>

<h2>THE FLYING TRUNK</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 83px;">
<img src="images/drop-t.png" width="83" height="100" alt="T" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'>HERE was once a merchant who was so
rich that he could have paved a whole
street with gold, and would even then have
had enough left for a small alley. He did not do
so; he knew the value of money better than to
use it in this way. So clever was he that every
shilling he put out brought him a crown, and so
it continued as long as he lived.</div>

<p>His son inherited his wealth, and lived a merry
life with it. He went to a masquerade every
night, made kites out of five-pound notes, and
threw pieces of gold into the sea instead of stones,
making ducks and drakes of them.</p>

<p>In this manner he soon lost all his money. At
last he had nothing left but a pair of slippers, an
old dressing gown, and four shillings. And now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
all his companions deserted him. They would not
walk with him in the streets, but one of them, who
was very good-natured, sent him an old trunk with
this message, "Pack up!"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "it is all very well to say 'pack
up.'" But he had nothing left to pack, therefore
he seated himself in the trunk.</p>

<p>It was a very wonderful trunk, for no sooner
did any one press on the lock than the trunk could
fly. He shut the lid and pressed the lock, when
away flew the trunk up the chimney, with him in
it, right up into the clouds. Whenever the bottom
of the trunk cracked he was in a great fright, for
if the trunk had fallen to pieces, he would have
turned a tremendous somersault over the trees.
However, he arrived safely in Turkey. He hid
the trunk in a wood under some dry leaves and
then went into the town. This he could do very
well, for among the Turks people always go about
in dressing gowns and slippers, just as he was.</p>

<p>He happened to meet a nurse with a little child.
"I say, you Turkish nurse," cried he, "what castle
is that near the town, with the windows placed
so high?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<p>"The Sultan's daughter lives there," she replied.
"It has been prophesied that she will be very
unhappy about a lover, and therefore no one is
allowed to visit her unless the king and queen
are present."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said the merchant's son. So he
went back to the wood, seated himself in his trunk,
flew up to the roof of the castle, and crept through
the window into the room where the princess lay
asleep on the sofa. She awoke and was very
much frightened, but he told her he was a Turkish
angel who had come down through the air to see
her. This pleased her very much. He sat down
by her side and talked to her, telling her that her
eyes were like beautiful dark lakes, in which the
thoughts swam about like little mermaids; and
that her forehead was a snowy mountain which
contained splendid halls full of pictures. He related
to her the story about the stork, who brings
the beautiful children from the rivers. These stories
delighted the princess, and when he asked her
if she would marry him, she consented immediately.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 332px;">
<img src="images/p293i.png" width="332" height="500" alt="&quot;Will you tell us a story?&quot; said the queen...." title="" />
</div>

<p>"But you must come on Saturday," she said,
"for then my parents will take tea with me. They<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
will be very proud when they find that I am going
to marry a Turkish angel. But you must think
of some very pretty stories to tell them, for they
like to hear stories better than anything. My
mother prefers one that is deep and moral, but
my father likes something funny, to make him
laugh."</p>

<p>"Very well," he replied, "I shall bring you no
other marriage portion than a story"; and so they
parted. But the princess gave him a sword
studded with gold coins, and these he could
make useful.</p>

<p>He flew away to the town and bought a new
dressing gown, and afterwards returned to the
wood, where he composed a story so as to be
ready by Saturday; and that was no easy matter.
It was ready, however, when he went to see the
princess on Saturday. The king and queen and
the whole court were at tea with the princess,
and he was received with great politeness.</p>

<p>"Will you tell us a story?" said the queen;
"one that is instructive and full of learning."</p>

<p>"Yes, but with something in it to laugh at,"
said the king.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>"Certainly," he replied, and commenced at
once, asking them to listen attentively.</p>

<p>"There was once a bundle of matches that were
exceedingly proud of their high descent. Their
genealogical tree&mdash;that is, a great pine tree from
which they had been cut&mdash;was at one time a
large old tree in the wood. The matches now lay
between a tinder box and an old iron saucepan
and were talking about their youthful days. 'Ah!
then we grew on the green boughs,' said they,
'and every morning and evening we were fed
with diamond drops of dew. Whenever the sun
shone we felt his warm rays, and the little birds
would relate stories to us in their songs. We
knew that we were rich, for the other trees only
wore their green dresses in summer, while our
family were able to array themselves in green,
summer and winter. But the woodcutter came
like a great disaster, and our family fell under
the ax. The head of the house obtained a situation
as mainmast in a very fine ship and can
sail round the world whenever he will. Other
branches of the family were taken to different
places, and our own office now is to kindle a light<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
for common people. This is how such highborn
people as we came to be in a kitchen.'</p>

<p>"'Mine has been a very different fate,' said the
iron pot, which stood by the matches. 'From my
first entrance into the world I have been used to
cooking and scouring. I am the first in this house
when anything solid or useful is required. My
only pleasure is to be made clean and shining
after dinner and to sit in my place and have a
little sensible conversation with my neighbors.
All of us excepting the water bucket, which is
sometimes taken into the courtyard, live here together
within these four walls. We get our news
from the market basket, but it sometimes tells us
very unpleasant things about the people and the
government. Yes, and one day an old pot was so
alarmed that it fell down and was broken in
pieces.'</p>

<p>"'You are talking too much,' said the tinder
box; and the steel struck against the flint till
some sparks flew out, crying, 'We want a merry
evening, don't we?'</p>

<p>"'Yes, of course,' said the matches. 'Let us
talk about those who are the highest born.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<p>"'No, I don't like to be always talking of
what we are,' remarked the saucepan. 'Let us
think of some other amusement; I will begin.
We will tell something that has happened to
ourselves; that will be very easy, and interesting
as well. On the Baltic Sea, near the Danish
shore&mdash;'</p>

<p>"'What a pretty commencement!' said the
plates. 'We shall all like that story, I am sure.'</p>

<p>"'Yes. Well, in my youth I lived in a quiet
family where the furniture was polished, the
floors scoured, and clean curtains put up, every
fortnight.'</p>

<p>"'What an interesting way you have of relating
a story,' said the carpet broom. 'It is easy to perceive
that you have been a great deal in society,
something so pure runs through what you say.'</p>

<p>"'That is quite true,' said the water bucket;
and it made a spring with joy and splashed some
water on the floor.</p>

<p>"Then the saucepan went on with its story,
and the end was as good as the beginning.</p>

<p>"The plates rattled with pleasure, and the
carpet broom brought some green parsley out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
of the dust hole and crowned the saucepan. It
knew this would vex the others, but it thought,
'If I crown him to-day, he will crown me to-morrow.'</p>

<p>"'Now let us have a dance,' said the fire
tongs. Then how they danced and stuck one
leg in the air! The chair cushion in the corner
burst with laughter at the sight.</p>

<p>"'Shall I be crowned now?' asked the fire
tongs. So the broom found another wreath for
the tongs.</p>

<p>"'They are only common people after all,'
thought the matches. The tea urn was now asked
to sing, but she said she had a cold and could
not sing unless she felt boiling heat within. They
all thought this was affectation; they also considered
it affectation that she did not wish to
sing except in the parlor, when on the table with
the grand people.</p>

<p>"In the window sat an old quill pen, with
which the maid generally wrote. There was
nothing remarkable about the pen, except that
it had been dipped too deeply in the ink; but it
was proud of that.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>"'If the tea urn won't sing,' said the pen,
'she needn't. There's a nightingale in a cage
outside, that can sing. She has not been taught
much, certainly, but we need not say anything
this evening about that.'</p>

<p>"'I think it highly improper,' said the teakettle,
who was kitchen singer and half brother
to the tea urn, 'that a rich foreign bird should
be listened to here. Is it patriotic? Let the
market basket decide what is right.'</p>

<p>"'I certainly am vexed,' said the basket, 'inwardly
vexed, more than any one can imagine.
Are we spending the evening properly? Would
it not be more sensible to put the house in
order? If each were in his own place, I would
lead a game. This would be quite another thing.'</p>

<p>"'Let us act a play,' said they all. At the
same moment the door opened and the maid
came in. Then not one stirred; they remained
quite still, although there was not a single pot
among them that had not a high opinion of himself
and of what he could do if he chose.</p>

<p>"'Yes, if we had chosen,' each of them thought,
'we might have spent a very pleasant evening.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>"The maid took the matches and lighted them,
and dear me, how they spluttered and blazed up!</p>

<p>"'Now then,' they thought, 'every one will see
that we are the first. How we shine! What a
light we give!' But even while they spoke their
lights went out."</p>

<p>"What a capital story!" said the queen. "I feel
as if I were really in the kitchen and could see
the matches. Yes, you shall marry our daughter."</p>

<p>"Certainly," said the king, "thou shalt have
our daughter." The king said "thou" to him because
he was going to be one of the family. The
wedding day was fixed, and on the evening before,
the whole city was illuminated. Cakes and sweetmeats
were thrown among the people. The street
boys stood on tiptoe and shouted "Hurrah," and
whistled between their fingers. Altogether it was
a very splendid affair.</p>

<p>"I will give them another treat," said the merchant's
son. So he went and bought rockets and
crackers and every kind of fireworks that could
be thought of, packed them in his trunk, and
flew up with it into the air. What a whizzing
and popping they made as they went off! The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
Turks, when they saw the sight, jumped so high
that their slippers flew about their ears. It was
easy to believe after this that the princess was
really going to marry a Turkish angel.</p>

<p>As soon as the merchant's son had come down
to the wood after the fireworks, he thought, "I
will go back into the town now and hear what
they think of the entertainment." It was very
natural that he should wish to know. And what
strange things people did say, to be sure! Every
one whom he questioned had a different tale to
tell, though they all thought it very beautiful.</p>

<p>"I saw the Turkish angel myself," said one.
"He had eyes like glittering stars and a head
like foaming water."</p>

<p>"He flew in a mantle of fire," said another,
"and lovely little cherubs peeped out from the
folds."</p>

<p>He heard many more fine things about himself
and that the next day he was to be married.
After this he went back to the forest to rest himself
in his trunk. It had disappeared! A spark
from the fireworks which remained had set it on
fire. It was burned to ashes. So the merchant's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
son could not fly any more, nor go to meet his
bride. She stood all day on the roof, waiting for
him, and most likely she is waiting there still,
while he wanders through the world telling fairy
tales&mdash;but none of them so amusing as the one
he related about the matches.</p>

</div>


<h2>THE BUTTERFLY</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 83px;">
<img src="images/drop-t.png" width="83" height="100" alt="T" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'>HERE was once a butterfly who wished
for a bride; and, as may be supposed, he
wanted to choose a very pretty one from
among the flowers. He glanced with a very critical
eye at all the flower beds and found that the
flowers were seated quietly and demurely on their
stalks, just as maidens should sit. But there was
a great number of them, and it appeared as if
making his choice would become very wearisome.
The butterfly did not like to take too much
trouble, so he flew off on a visit to the daisies.</div>

<p>The French call this flower Marguerite and
say that it can prophesy. Lovers pluck off the
leaves, and as they pluck each leaf they ask a
question about their sweethearts, thus: "Does he
or she love me? Dearly? Distractedly? Very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
much? A little? Not at all?" and so on. Each
one speaks these words in his own language.</p>

<p>The butterfly came, also, to Marguerite to
inquire, but he did not pluck off her leaves;
he pressed a kiss on each of them, for he
thought there was always more to be done by
kindness.</p>

<p>"Darling Marguerite daisy," he said to her, "you
are the wisest woman of them all. Pray tell me
which of the flowers I shall choose for my wife.
Which will be my bride? When I know, I will
fly directly to her and propose."</p>

<p>But Marguerite did not answer him. She was
offended that he should call her a woman when
she was only a girl; there is a great difference.
He asked her a second time, and then a third,
but she remained dumb, answering him not at
all. Then he would wait no longer, but flew
away to commence his wooing at once. It was
in the early spring, when the crocus and the
snowdrop were in full bloom.</p>

<p>"They are very pretty," thought the butterfly;
"charming little lasses, but they are rather stiff
and formal."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, as young lads often do, he looked out
for the older girls. He next flew to the anemones,
but these were rather sour to his taste.
The violet was a little too sentimental; the lime
blossoms were too small&mdash;and, besides, there was
such a large family of them. The apple blossoms,
though they looked like roses, bloomed to-day,
but might fall off to-morrow with the first wind
that blew; and he thought a marriage with one
of them might last too short a time. The pea
blossom pleased him most of all. She was white
and red, graceful and slender, and belonged to
those domestic maidens who have a pretty appearance,
yet can be useful in the kitchen. He
was just about to make her an offer when, close
by her, he saw a pod, with a withered flower
hanging at the end.</p>

<p>"Who is that?" he asked.</p>

<p>"That is my sister," replied the pea blossom.</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed! and you will be like her some
day," said he. And at once he flew away, for he
felt quite shocked.</p>

<p>A honeysuckle hung forth from the hedge, in
full bloom; but there were so many girls like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
her, with long faces and sallow complexions! No,
he did not like her. But which one did he like?</p>

<p>Spring went by, and summer drew toward its
close. Autumn came, but he had not decided.
The flowers now appeared in their most gorgeous
robes, but all in vain&mdash;they had not the fresh,
fragrant air of youth. The heart asks for fragrance
even when it is no longer young, and
there is very little of that to be found in the
dahlias or the dry chrysanthemums. Therefore
the butterfly turned to the mint on the ground.
This plant, you know, has no blossom, but is
sweetness all over; it is full of fragrance from
head to foot, with the scent of a flower in
every leaf.</p>

<p>"I will take her," said the butterfly; and he
made her an offer. But the mint stood silent and
stiff as she listened to him. At last she said:</p>

<p>"I can give you friendship if you like, nothing
more. I am old, and you are old, but we may
live for each other just the same. As to marrying,
however, no! that would appear ridiculous
at our age."</p>

<p>And so it happened that the butterfly got no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
wife at all. He had been too long choosing,
which is always a bad plan, and became what
is called an old bachelor.</p>

<p>It was late in the autumn, with rainy and
cloudy weather. The cold wind blew over the
bowed backs of the willows, so that they creaked
again. It was not the weather for flying about in
summer clothes, but fortunately the butterfly was
not out in it. By a happy chance he had got a
shelter. It was in a room heated by a stove and
as warm as summer. He could live here, he said,
well enough.</p>

<p>"But it is not enough merely to exist," said he.
"I need freedom, sunshine, and a little flower for
a companion."</p>

<p>So he flew against the window-pane and was
seen and admired by those in the room, who
caught him and stuck him on a pin in a box of
curiosities. They could not do more for him.</p>

<p>"Now I am perched on a stalk like the flowers,"
said the butterfly. "It is not very pleasant, certainly.
I imagine it is something like being
married, for here I am stuck fast." And with
this thought he consoled himself a little.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>

<p>"That seems very poor consolation," said one
of the plants in the room, that grew in a pot.</p>

<p>"Ah," thought the butterfly, "one can't very
well trust these plants in pots; they have had
too much to do with human beings."</p>

</div>


<h2>THE GOBLIN AND THE HUCKSTER</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 83px;">
<img src="images/drop-t.png" width="83" height="100" alt="T" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'>HERE was once a regular student, who
lived in a garret and had no possessions.
And there was also a regular huckster,
to whom the house belonged, and who occupied
the ground floor. A goblin lived with the
huckster because at Christmas he always had a
large dishful of jam, with a great piece of butter
in the middle. The huckster could afford this,
and therefore the goblin remained with him&mdash;which
was very shrewd of the goblin.</div>

<p>One evening the student came into the shop
through the back door to buy candles and cheese
for himself; he had no one to send, and therefore
he came himself. He obtained what he wished,
and then the huckster and his wife nodded good
evening to him. The huckster's wife was a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
woman who could do more than merely nod, for
she usually had plenty to say for herself. The
student nodded also, as he turned to leave, then
suddenly stopped and began reading the piece
of paper in which the cheese was wrapped. It
was a leaf torn out of an old book; a book that
ought not to have been torn up, for it was full
of poetry.</p>

<p>"Yonder lies some more of the same sort,"
said the huckster. "I gave an old woman a few
coffee berries for it; you shall have the rest for
sixpence if you will."</p>

<p>"Indeed I will," said the student. "Give me
the book instead of the cheese; I can eat my
bread and butter without cheese. It would be a
sin to tear up a book like this. You are a clever
man and a practical man, but you understand no
more about poetry than that cask yonder."</p>

<p>This was a very rude speech, especially against
the cask, but the huckster and the student both
laughed, for it was only said in fun. The goblin,
however, felt very angry that any man should
venture to say such things to a huckster who was
a householder and sold the best butter. As soon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
as it was night, the shop closed, and every one
in bed except the student, the goblin stepped
softly into the bedroom where the huckster's
wife slept, and took away her tongue, which of
course she did not then want. Whatever object
in the room he placed this tongue upon, immediately
received voice and speech and was able to
express its thoughts and feelings as readily as
the lady herself could do. It could only be used
by one object at a time, which was a good thing,
as a number speaking at once would have caused
great confusion. The goblin laid the tongue
upon the cask, in which lay a quantity of old
newspapers.</p>

<p>"Is it really true," he asked, "that you do not
know what poetry is?"</p>

<p>"Of course I know," replied the cask. "Poetry
is something that always stands in the corner of
a newspaper and is sometimes cut out. And I
may venture to affirm that I have more of it in
me than the student has, even if I am only a
poor tub of the huckster's."</p>

<p>Then the goblin placed the tongue on the
coffee mill, and how it did go, to be sure! Then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
he put it on the butter-tub, and the cash-box,
and they all expressed the same opinion as the
waste-paper tub. A majority must always be
respected.</p>

<p>"Now I shall go and tell the student," said the
goblin. With these words he went quietly up the
back stairs to the garret, where the student lived.
The student's candle was burning still, and the
goblin peeped through the keyhole and saw that
he was reading in the torn book which he had
bought out of the shop. But how light the room
was! From the book shot forth a ray of light
which grew broad and full like the stem of a
tree, from which bright rays spread upward and
over the student's head. Each leaf was fresh,
and each flower was like a beautiful female head&mdash;some
with dark and sparkling eyes and others
with eyes that were wonderfully blue and clear.
The fruit gleamed like stars, and the room was
filled with sounds of beautiful music. The little
goblin had never imagined, much less seen or
heard of, any sight so glorious as this. He stood
still on tiptoe, peeping in, till the light went out.
The student no doubt had blown out his candle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
and gone to bed, but the little goblin remained
standing there, listening to the music which still
sounded, soft and beautiful&mdash;a sweet cradle song
for the student who had lain down to rest.</p>

<p>"This is a wonderful place," said the goblin;
"I never expected such a thing. I should like to
stay here with the student." Then the little man
thought it over, for he was a sensible sprite. At
last he sighed, "But the student has no jam!" So
he went downstairs again to the huckster's shop,
and it was a good thing he got back when he did,
for the cask had almost worn out the lady's tongue.
He had given a description of all that he contained
on one side, and was just about to turn himself
over to the other side to describe what was there,
when the goblin entered and restored the tongue
to the lady. From that time forward, the whole
shop, from the cash-box down to the pine-wood
logs, formed their opinions from that of the cask.
They all had such confidence in him and treated
him with so much respect that when, in the evening,
the huckster read the criticisms on theatricals
and art, they fancied it must all come from
the cask.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span></p>

<p>After what he had seen, the goblin could no
longer sit and listen quietly to the wisdom and
understanding downstairs. As soon as the evening
light glimmered in the garret, he took courage,
for it seemed to him that the rays of light were
strong cables, drawing him up and obliging him
to go and peep through the keyhole. While there,
a feeling of vastness came over him, such as we
experience by the ever-moving sea when the
storm breaks forth, and it brought tears into his
eyes. He did not himself know why he wept, yet
a kind of pleasant feeling mingled with his tears.
"How wonderfully glorious it would be to sit with
the student under such a tree!" But that was out
of the question; he must be content to look through
the keyhole and be thankful for even that.</p>

<p>There he stood on the cold landing, with the
autumn wind blowing down upon him through
the trapdoor. It was very cold, but the little
creature did not really feel it till the light in the
garret went out and the tones of music died away.
Then how he shivered and crept downstairs again
to his warm corner, where he felt at home and
comfortable! And when Christmas came again<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
and brought the dish of jam and the great lump
of butter, he liked the huckster best of all.</p>

<p>Soon after, the goblin was waked in the middle
of the night by a terrible noise and knocking
against the window shutters and the house doors
and by the sound of the watchman's horn. A
great fire had broken out, and the whole street
seemed full of flames. Was it in their house or a
neighbor's? No one could tell, for terror had
seized upon all. The huckster's wife was so bewildered
that she took her gold earrings out of
her ears and put them in her pocket, that she
might save something at least. The huckster ran
to get his business papers, and the servant resolved
to save her black silk mantle, which she had
managed to buy. All wished to keep the best
things they had. The goblin had the same wish,
for with one spring he was upstairs in the
student's room. He found him standing by the
open window and looking quite calmly at the fire,
which was raging in the house of a neighbor
opposite.</p>

<p>The goblin caught up the wonderful book, which
lay on the table, and popped it into his red<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
cap, which he held tightly with both hands. The
greatest treasure in the house was saved, and he
ran away with it to the roof and seated himself
on the chimney. The flames of the burning
house opposite illuminated him as he sat with
both hands pressed tightly over his cap, in which
the treasure lay. It was then that he understood
what feelings were really strongest in his heart
and knew exactly which way they tended. Yet,
when the fire was extinguished and the goblin
again began to reflect, he hesitated, and said at
last, "I must divide myself between the two; I
cannot quite give up the huckster, because of
the jam."</p>

<p>This is a representation of human nature. We
are like the goblin; we all go to visit the huckster,
"because of the jam."</p>

<h2>EVERYTHING IN ITS RIGHT PLACE</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 115px;">
<img src="images/drop-m.png" width="115" height="100" alt="M" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'>ORE than a hundred years ago, behind
the wood and by a deep lake, stood an
old baronial mansion. Round it lay a
deep moat, in which grew reeds and rushes, and
close by the bridge, near the entrance gate, stood
an old willow that bent itself over the moat.</div>

<p>From a narrow lane one day sounded the
clang of horns and the trampling of horses. The
little girl who kept the geese hastened to drive
them away from the bridge before the hunting
party came galloping up to it. They came, however,
with such haste that the girl was obliged to
climb up and seat herself on the parapet of the
bridge, lest they should ride over her. She was
scarcely more than a child, with a pretty, delicate
figure, a gentle expression of face, and two bright<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
blue eyes&mdash;all of which the baron took no note
of; but as he galloped past, he reversed the
whip held in his hand, and in rough play gave
the little goose-watcher such a push with the butt
end that she fell backward into the ditch.</p>

<p>"Everything in its right place," cried he. "Into
the puddle with you!" and then he laughed aloud
at what he called his own wit, and the rest joined
with him. The whole party shouted and screamed,
and the dogs barked loudly.</p>

<p>Fortunately for herself, the poor girl in falling
caught hold of one of the overhanging branches
of the willow tree, by which she was able to keep
herself from falling into the muddy pool. As
soon as the baron, with his company and his
dogs, had disappeared through the castle gate,
she tried to raise herself by her own exertions;
but the bough broke off at the top, and she would
have fallen backwards among the reeds if a strong
hand had not at that moment seized her from
above. It was the hand of a peddler, who, at a
short distance, had witnessed the whole affair and
hastened up to give assistance.</p>

<p>"Everything in its right place," he said, imitating<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
the noble baron, as he drew the little maiden
up on dry ground. He would have restored the
bough to the place from which it had been broken
off, but "everything in its right place" is not
always so easy to arrange, so he stuck the bough
in the soft earth. "Grow and prosper as much as
you can," said he, "till you produce a good flute
for some of them over there. With the permission
of the noble baron and his family, I should like
them to hear my challenge."</p>

<p>So he betook himself to the castle, but not into
the noble hall; he was too humble for that. He
went to the servants' apartments, and the men
and maids examined and turned over his stock of
goods, while from above, where the company were
at table, came sounds of screaming and shouting
which they called singing&mdash;and indeed they did
their best. Loud laughter, mingled with the howling
of dogs, sounded through the open windows.
All were feasting and carousing. Wine and strong
ale foamed in the jugs and glasses; even the dogs
ate and drank with their masters. The peddler
was sent for, but only to make fun for them. The
wine had mounted to their heads, and the sense<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
had flown out. They poured wine into a stocking
for him to drink with them&mdash;quickly, of course&mdash;and
this was considered a rare jest and occasioned
fresh bursts of laughter. At cards, whole farms,
with their stock of peasants and cattle, were staked
on a card and lost.</p>

<p>"Everything in its right place," said the peddler,
when he at last escaped from what he called the
Sodom and Gomorrah up there. "The open highroad
is my right place; that house did not suit
me at all." As he stepped along, he saw the little
maiden keeping watch over the geese, and she
nodded to him in a friendly way.</p>

<p>Days and weeks passed, and it soon became
evident that the willow branch which had been
stuck in the ground by the peddler, near to the
castle moat, had taken root, for it remained fresh
and green and put forth new twigs.</p>

<p>The little girl saw that the branch must have
taken root, and she was quite joyful about it.
"This tree," she said, "must be my tree now."</p>

<p>The tree certainly flourished, but at the castle,
what with feasting and gambling, everything went
to ruin; for these two things are like rollers, upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
which no man can possibly stand securely. Six
years had not passed away before the noble baron
wandered out of the castle gate a poor man, and
the mansion was bought by a rich dealer. This
dealer was no other than the man of whom he had
made fun and for whom he had poured wine into
a stocking to drink. But honesty and industry
are like favorable winds to a ship, and they had
brought the peddler to be master of the baron's
estates. From that hour no more card playing
was permitted there.</p>

<p>The new proprietor took to himself a wife, and
who should it be but the little goose-watcher, who
had always remained faithful and good, and who
looked as beautiful and fine in her new clothes as
if she had been a highly born lady. It would be
too long a story in these busy times to explain
how all this came about, but it really did happen,
and the most important part is to come.</p>

<p>It was pleasant to live in the old court now.
The mistress herself managed the housekeeping
within, and the master superintended the estate.
Their home overflowed with blessings, for where
rectitude leads the way, prosperity is sure to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
follow. The old house was cleaned and painted,
the moat dried up, and fruit trees planted in it.
The floors of the house were polished as smoothly
as a draftboard, and everything looked bright and
cheerful.</p>

<p>During the long winter evenings the lady of
the house sat with her maidens at the spinning
wheel in the great hall. Her husband, in his old
age, had been made a magistrate. Every Sunday
evening he read the Bible with his family, for
children had come to him and were all instructed
in the best manner, although they were not all
equally clever&mdash;as is the case in all families. In
the meantime, the willow branch at the castle gate
had grown into a splendid tree and stood free and
unrestrained.</p>

<p>"That is our genealogical tree," said the old
people, "and the tree must therefore be honored
and esteemed, even by those who are not very
wise."</p>

<p>A hundred years passed away, and the place
presented a much-changed aspect. The lake had
been converted into moorland, and the old baronial
castle had almost disappeared. A pool of water,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
the deep moat, and the ruins of some of the walls
were all that remained. Close by grew a magnificent
willow tree, with overhanging branches&mdash;the
same genealogical tree of former times. Here
it still stood, showing to what beauty a willow
can attain when left to itself. To be sure, the
trunk was split through, from the root to the top,
and the storm had slightly bent it; but it stood
firm through all, and from every crevice and
opening into which earth had been carried by the
wind, shot forth blossoms and flowers. Near the
top, where the large boughs parted, the wild
raspberry twined its branches and looked like
a hanging garden. Even the little mistletoe had
here struck root, and flourished, graceful and
delicate, among the branches of the willow, which
were reflected in the dark waters beneath it.
Sometimes the wind from the sea scattered the
willow leaves. A path led through the field, close
by the tree.</p>

<p>On the top of a hill, near the forest, with a
splendid prospect before it, stood the new baronial
hall, with panes of such transparent glass in the
windows that there appeared to be none. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
grand flight of steps leading to the entrance
looked like a bower of roses and broad-leaved
plants. The lawn was as fresh and green as if
each separate blade of grass were cleaned morning
and evening. In the hall hung costly pictures.
The chairs and sofas were of silk and velvet and
looked almost as if they could move of themselves.
There were tables with white marble tops, and
books bound in velvet and gold. Here, indeed,
resided wealthy people, people of rank&mdash;the new
baron and his family.</p>

<p>Each article was made to harmonize with the
other furnishings. The family motto still was,
"Everything in its right place." Therefore the
pictures which were once the honor and glory of
the old house now hung in the passage leading
to the servants' hall. They were considered mere
lumber; especially two old portraits, one of a man
in a wig and a rose-colored coat, the other of a
lady with frizzed and powdered hair, holding a
rose in her hand, each surrounded by a wreath
of willow leaves. Both the pictures had many
holes in them, for the little barons always set up
the two old people as targets for their bows and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
arrows; and yet these were pictures of the magistrate
and his lady, from whom the present family
were descended. "But they did not properly belong
to our family," said one of the little barons;
"he was a peddler, and she kept the geese. They
were not like papa and mamma." So the pictures,
being old, were considered worthless; and the
motto being "Each in its right place," the great-grandfather
and the great-grandmother of the
family were sent into the passage leading to the
servants' hall.</p>

<p>The son of the clergyman of the place was
tutor at the great house. One day he was out
walking with his pupils&mdash;the little barons&mdash;and
their eldest sister, who had just been confirmed.
They took the path through the fields, which led
past the old willow tree. While they walked, the
young lady made a wreath of hedge blossoms and
wild flowers, "each in its right place," and the
wreath was, as a whole, very pretty. At the same
time she heard every word uttered by the son of
the clergyman. She liked very much to hear him
talk of the wonders of nature and of the great
men and women of history. She had a healthy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
mind, with nobility of thought and feeling, and
a heart full of love for all God's creation.</p>

<p>The walking party halted at the old willow tree;
the youngest of the barons wanted a branch from
it to make a flute, as he had already made them
from other willows. The tutor broke off a branch.
"Oh, don't do that," exclaimed the young baroness;
but it was already done. "I am so sorry,"
she continued; "that is our famous old tree, and
I love it very much. They laugh at me for it at
home, but I don't mind. There is a story told
about that tree."</p>

<p>Then she told him what we already know: about
the old castle, and about the peddler and the girl
with the geese, who had met at this spot for the
first time and were the ancestors of the noble
family to which the young baroness belonged.
"The good old folks would not be ennobled,"
said she. "Their motto was 'Everything in its
right place,' and they thought it would not be right
for them to purchase a title with money. My
grandfather, the first baron, was their son. He was
a very learned man, known and appreciated by
princes and princesses, and was present at all the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
festivals at court. At home, they all love him
best, but I scarcely know why. There seems to
me something in the first old pair that draws
my heart towards them. How sociable, how patriarchal,
it must have been in the old house, where
the mistress sat at the spinning wheel with her
maids while her husband read aloud to them
from the Bible!"</p>

<p>"They must have been charming, sensible
people," said the tutor, and then the conversation
turned upon nobles and commoners. It was almost
as if the tutor did not belong to an inferior
class, he spoke so wisely upon the purpose and
intention of nobility.</p>

<p>"It is certainly good fortune to belong to a
family that has distinguished itself in the world,
and to inherit the energy which spurs us on to
progress in everything noble and useful. It is
pleasant to bear a family name that is like a card
of admission to the highest circles. True nobility
is always great and honorable. It is a coin which
has received the impression of its own value. It
is a mistake of the present day, into which many
poets have fallen, to affirm that all who are noble<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
by birth must therefore be wicked or foolish, and
that the lower we descend in society the oftener
we find great and shining characters. I feel that
this is quite false. In all classes can be found
men and women possessing kindly and beautiful
traits.</p>

<p>"My mother told me of one, and I could tell
you of many more. She was once on a visit to a
nobleman's house in the town; my grandmother,
I believe, had been brought up in the family. One
day, when my mother and the nobleman happened
to be alone, an old woman came limping into the
court on crutches. She was accustomed to come
every Sunday and always carried away a gift with
her. 'Ah, there is the poor old woman,' said the
nobleman; 'what pain it is for her to walk!' And
before my mother understood what he said, he
had left the room and run downstairs to the old
woman. Though seventy years old himself, the
old nobleman carried to the woman the gift she
had come to receive, to spare her the pain of
walking any farther. This is only a trifling circumstance,
but, like the two mites given by the
widow in the Bible, it wakes an echo in the heart.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span></p>

<p>"These are subjects of which poets should write
and sing, for they soften and unite mankind into
one brotherhood. But when a mere sprig of
humanity, because it has noble ancestors of good
blood, rears up and prances like an Arabian horse
in the street or speaks contemptuously of common
people, then it is nobility in danger of decay&mdash;a
mere pretense, like the mask which Thespis
invented. People are glad to see such persons
turned into objects of satire."</p>

<p>This was the tutor's speech&mdash;certainly rather
a long one, but he had been busily engaged in
cutting the flute while he talked.</p>

<p>There was a large party at the Hall that evening.
The grand salon was crowded with guests&mdash;some
from the neighborhood, some from the
capital. There was a bevy of ladies richly dressed
with, and without, taste; a group of the clergy
from the adjoining parishes, in a corner together,
as grave as though met for a funeral. A funeral
party it certainly was not, however; it was meant
for a party of pleasure, but the pleasure was yet
to come. Music and song filled the rooms, first
one of the party volunteering, then another. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
little baron brought out his flute, but neither he
nor his father, who tried it after him, could make
anything of it. It was pronounced a failure.</p>

<p>"But you are a performer, too, surely," said
a witty gentleman, addressing the tutor. "You
are of course a flute player as well as a flute
maker. You are a universal genius, I hear, and
genius is quite the rage nowadays&mdash;nothing like
genius. Come now; I am sure you will be so
good as to enchant us by playing on this little
instrument." He handed it over, announcing in
a loud voice that the tutor was going to favor
the company with a solo on the flute.</p>

<p>It was easy to see that these people wanted
to make fun of him, and he refused to play.
But they pressed him so long and so urgently
that at last, in very weariness, he took the flute
and raised it to his lips.</p>

<p>It was a strange flute! A sound issued from
it, loud, shrill, and vibrating, like that sent forth
by a steam engine&mdash;nay, far louder. It thrilled
through the house, through garden and woodland,
miles out into the country; and with the sound
came also a strong, rushing wind, its stormy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
breath clearly uttering the words, "Everything
in its right place!"</p>

<p>Forthwith the baron, the master of the Hall,
was caught up by the wind, carried out at the
window, and was shut up in the porter's lodge
in a trice. The porter himself was borne up, not
into the drawing room&mdash;no, for that he was not
fit&mdash;but into the servants' hall, where the proud
lackeys in their silk stockings shook with horror
to see so low a person sit at table with them.</p>

<p>But in the grand salon the young baroness
was wafted to the seat of honor, where she was
worthy to sit, and the tutor's place was by her
side. There they sat together, for all the world
like bride and bridegroom. An old count, descended
from one of the noblest houses in the
land, retained his seat, not so much as a breath
of air disturbing him, for the flute was strictly
just. The witty young gentleman, who had been
the occasion of all this tumult, was whirled out
headforemost to join geese and ganders in the
poultry yard.</p>

<p>Half a mile out in the country the flute
wrought wonders. The family of a rich merchant,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
who drove with four horses, were all precipitated
from the carriage window. Two farmers, who had
of late grown too wealthy to know their nearest
relations, were puffed into a ditch. It was a
dangerous flute. Luckily, at the first sound it
uttered, it burst and was then put safely away in
the tutor's pocket. "Everything in its right place!"</p>

<p>Next day no more was said about the adventure
than as if it had never happened. The affair was
hushed up, and all things were the same as before,
except that the two old portraits of the peddler
and the goose girl continued to hang on the walls
of the salon, whither the wind had blown them.
Here some connoisseur chanced to see them, and
because he pronounced them to be painted by a
master hand, they were cleaned and restored and
ever after held in honor. Their value had not
been known before.</p>

<p>"Everything in its right place!" So shall it be,
all in good time, never fear. Not in this world,
perhaps. That would be expecting rather too
much.</p>

<h2>THE REAL PRINCESS</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 83px;">
<img src="images/drop-t.png" width="83" height="100" alt="T" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'>HERE was once a prince who wanted to
marry a princess. But she must be a real
princess, mind you. So he traveled all
round the world, seeking such a one, but everywhere
something was in the way. Not that there
was any lack of princesses, but he could not seem
to make out whether they were real princesses;
there was always something not quite satisfactory.
Therefore, home he came again, quite out of spirits,
for he wished so much to marry a real princess.</div>

<p>One evening a terrible storm came on. It
thundered and lightened, and the rain poured
down; indeed, it was quite fearful. In the midst
of it there came a knock at the town gate, and
the old king went out to open it.</p>

<p>It was a princess who stood outside. But O
dear, what a state she was in from the rain and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
bad weather! The water dropped from her hair
and clothes, it ran in at the tips of her shoes and
out at the heels; yet she insisted she was a real
princess.</p>

<p>"Very well," thought the old queen; "that
we shall presently see." She said nothing, but
went into the bedchamber and took off all the
bedding, then laid a pea on the sacking of the
bedstead. Having done this, she took twenty
mattresses and laid them upon the pea and
placed twenty eider-down beds on top of the
mattresses.</p>

<p>The princess lay upon this bed all the night.
In the morning she was asked how she had slept.</p>

<p>"Oh, most miserably!" she said. "I scarcely
closed my eyes the whole night through. I cannot
think what there could have been in the bed. I
lay upon something so hard that I am quite
black and blue all over. It is dreadful!"</p>

<p>It was now quite evident that she was a real
princess, since through twenty mattresses and
twenty eider-down beds she had felt the pea.
None but a real princess could have such delicate
feeling.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span></p>

<p>So the prince took her for his wife, for he
knew that in her he had found a true princess.
And the pea was preserved in the cabinet of
curiosities, where it is still to be seen unless
some one has stolen it.</p>

<p>And this, mind you, is a real story.</p>

<h2>THE EMPEROR'S NEW CLOTHES</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 115px;">
<img src="images/drop-m.png" width="115" height="100" alt="M" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'>ANY years ago there was an emperor
who was so fond of new clothes that
he spent all his money on them. He
did not give himself any concern about his army;
he cared nothing about the theater or for driving
about in the woods, except for the sake of
showing himself off in new clothes. He had a
costume for every hour in the day, and just as
they say of a king or emperor, "He is in his
council chamber," they said of him, "The emperor
is in his dressing room."</div>

<p>Life was merry and gay in the town where the
emperor lived, and numbers of strangers came to
it every day. Among them there came one day
two rascals, who gave themselves out as weavers
and said that they knew how to weave the most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
exquisite stuff imaginable. Not only were the
colors and patterns uncommonly beautiful, but
the clothes that were made of the stuff had the
peculiar property of becoming invisible to every
person who was unfit for the office he held or
who was exceptionally stupid.</p>

<p>"Those must be valuable clothes," thought the
emperor. "By wearing them I should be able to
discover which of the men in my empire are not
fit for their posts. I should distinguish wise men
from fools. Yes, I must order some of the stuff
to be woven for me directly." And he paid the
swindlers a handsome sum of money in advance,
as they required.</p>

<p>As for them, they put up two looms and pretended
to be weaving, though there was nothing
whatever on their shuttles. They called for a
quantity of the finest silks and of the purest gold
thread, all of which went into their own bags,
while they worked at their empty looms till late
into the night.</p>

<p>"I should like to know how those weavers are
getting on with the stuff," thought the emperor.
But he felt a little queer when he reflected that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
those who were stupid or unfit for their office
would not be able to see the material. He believed,
indeed, that he had nothing to fear for
himself, but still he thought it better to send
some one else first, to see how the work was coming
on. All the people in the town had heard
of the peculiar property of the stuff, and every
one was curious to see how stupid his neighbor
might be.</p>

<p>"I will send my faithful old prime minister to
the weavers," thought the emperor. "He will be
best capable of judging of this stuff, for he is a
man of sense and nobody is more fit for his
office than he."</p>

<p>So the worthy old minister went into the room
where the two swindlers sat working the empty
looms. "Heaven save us!" thought the old man,
opening his eyes wide. "Why, I can't see anything
at all!" But he took care not to say
so aloud.</p>

<p>Both the rogues begged him to step a little
nearer and asked him if he did not think the
patterns very pretty and the coloring fine. They
pointed to the empty loom as they did so, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
the poor old minister kept staring as hard as he
could&mdash;but without being able to see anything on
it, for of course there was nothing there to see.</p>

<p>"Heaven save us!" thought the old man. "Is
it possible that I am a fool? I have never
thought it, and nobody must know it. Is it true
that I am not fit for my office? It will never do
for me to say that I cannot see the stuffs."</p>

<p>"Well, sir, do you say nothing about the
cloth?" asked the one who was pretending to
go on with his work.</p>

<p>"Oh, it is most elegant, most beautiful!" said
the dazed old man, as he peered again through
his spectacles. "What a fine pattern, and what
fine colors! I will certainly tell the emperor how
pleased I am with the stuff."</p>

<p>"We are glad of that," said both the weavers;
and then they named the colors and pointed out
the special features of the pattern. To all of this
the minister paid great attention, so that he
might be able to repeat it to the emperor when
he went back to him.</p>

<p>And now the cheats called for more money,
more silk, and more gold thread, to be able to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
proceed with the weaving, but they put it all into
their own pockets, and not a thread went into the
stuff, though they went on as before, weaving at
the empty looms.</p>

<p>After a little time the emperor sent another
honest statesman to see how the weaving was
progressing, and if the stuff would soon be ready.
The same thing happened with him as with the minister.
He gazed and gazed, but as there was nothing
but empty looms, he could see nothing else.</p>

<p>"Is not this an exquisite piece of stuff?" asked
the weavers, pointing to one of the looms and
explaining the beautiful pattern and the colors
which were not there to be seen.</p>

<p>"I am not stupid, I know I am not!" thought
the man, "so it must be that I am not fit for my
good office. It is very strange, but I must not
let it be noticed." So he praised the cloth he
did not see and assured the weavers of his
delight in the lovely colors and the exquisite
pattern. "It is perfectly charming," he reported
to the emperor.</p>

<p>Everybody in the town was talking of the
splendid cloth. The emperor thought he should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
like to see it himself while it was still on the
loom. With a company of carefully selected
men, among whom were the two worthy officials
who had been there before, he went to visit the
crafty impostors, who were working as hard as
ever at the empty looms.</p>

<p>"Is it not magnificent?" said both the honest
statesmen. "See, your Majesty, what splendid
colors, and what a pattern!" And they pointed
to the looms, for they believed that others, no
doubt, could see what they did not.</p>

<p>"What!" thought the emperor. "I see nothing
at all. This is terrible! Am I a fool? Am
I not fit to be emperor? Why nothing more
dreadful could happen to me!"</p>

<p>"Oh, it is very pretty! it has my highest approval,"
the emperor said aloud. He nodded with
satisfaction as he gazed at the empty looms, for
he would not betray that he could see nothing.</p>

<p>His whole suite gazed and gazed, each seeing
no more than the others; but, like the emperor,
they all exclaimed, "Oh, it is beautiful!" They
even suggested to the emperor that he wear the
splendid new clothes for the first time on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
occasion of a great procession which was soon
to take place.</p>

<p>"Splendid! Gorgeous! Magnificent!" went
from mouth to mouth. All were equally delighted
with the weavers' workmanship. The emperor
gave each of the impostors an order of knighthood
to be worn in their buttonholes, and the
title Gentleman Weaver of the Imperial Court.</p>

<p>Before the day on which the procession was to
take place, the weavers sat up the whole night,
burning sixteen candles, so that people might
see how anxious they were to get the emperor's
new clothes ready. They pretended to take the
stuff from the loom, they cut it out in the air
with huge scissors, and they stitched away with
needles which had no thread in them. At last
they said, "Now the clothes are finished."</p>

<p>The emperor came to them himself with his
grandest courtiers, and each of the rogues lifted
his arm as if he held something, saying, "See!
here are the trousers! here is the coat! here is
the cloak," and so on. "It is as light as a spider's
web. One would almost feel as if one had nothing
on, but that is the beauty of it!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," said all the courtiers, but they saw
nothing, for there was nothing to see.</p>

<p>"Will your Majesty be graciously pleased to
take off your clothes so that we may put on the
new clothes here, before the great mirror?"</p>

<p>The emperor took off his clothes, and the
rogues pretended to put on first one garment and
then another of the new ones they had pretended
to make. They pretended to fasten something
round his waist and to tie on something. This
they said was the train, and the emperor turned
round and round before the mirror.</p>

<p>"How well his Majesty looks in the new
clothes! How becoming they are!" cried all the
courtiers in turn. "That is a splendid costume!"</p>

<p>"The canopy that is to be carried over your
Majesty in the procession is waiting outside,"
said the master of ceremonies.</p>

<p>"Well, I am ready," replied the emperor.
"Don't the clothes look well?" and he turned
round and round again before the mirror, to
appear as if he were admiring his new costume.</p>

<p>The chamberlains, who were to carry the train,
stooped and put their hands near the floor as if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
they were lifting it; then they pretended to be holding
something in the air. They would not let it be
noticed that they could see and feel nothing.</p>

<p>So the emperor went along in the procession,
under the splendid canopy, and every one in the
streets said: "How beautiful the emperor's new
clothes are! What a splendid train! And how
well they fit!"</p>

<p>No one wanted to let it appear that he could
see nothing, for that would prove him not fit for
his post. None of the emperor's clothes had been
so great a success before.</p>

<p>"But he has nothing on!" said a little child.</p>

<p>"Just listen to the innocent," said its father;
and one person whispered to another what the
child had said. "He has nothing on; a child
says he has nothing on!"</p>

<p>"But he has nothing on," cried all the people.
The emperor was startled by this, for he had a
suspicion that they were right. But he thought,
"I must face this out to the end and go on with
the procession." So he held himself more stiffly
than ever, and the chamberlains held up the train
that was not there at all.</p>

<h2>GREAT CLAUS AND LITTLE CLAUS</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 38px;">
<img src="images/drop-i.png" width="38" height="100" alt="I" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'>N A VILLAGE there once lived two men of
the same name. Both of them were called
Claus. But because one of them owned four
horses while the other had but one, people called
the one who had the four horses Big, or Great,
Claus and the one who owned but a single horse
Little Claus. Now I shall tell you what happened
to each of them, for this is a true story.</div>

<p>All the days of the week Little Claus was
obliged to plow for Great Claus and to lend him
his one horse; then once a week, on Sunday,
Great Claus helped Little Claus with his four
horses, but always on a holiday.</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" How Little Claus would crack
his whip over the five, for they were as good
as his own on that one day.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span></p>

<p>The sun shone brightly, and the church bells
rang merrily as the people passed by. The people
were dressed in their best, with their prayer
books under their arms, for they were going to
church to hear the clergyman preach. They
looked at Little Claus plowing with five horses,
and he was so proud and merry that he cracked
his whip and cried, "Gee-up, my fine horses."</p>

<p>"You mustn't say that," said Great Claus, "for
only one of them is yours."</p>

<p>But Little Claus soon forgot what it was that
he ought not to say, and when any one went by
he would call out, "Gee-up, my fine horses."</p>

<p>"I must really beg you not to say that again,"
said Great Claus as he passed; "for if you do, I
shall hit your horse on the head so that he will
drop down dead on the spot, and then it will be
all over with him."</p>

<p>"I will certainly not say it again, I promise
you," said Little Claus. But as soon as any one
came by, nodding good day to him, he was so
pleased, and felt so grand at having five horses
plowing his field, that again he cried out, "Gee-up,
all my horses."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll gee-up your horses for you," said Great
Claus, and he caught up the tethering mallet and
struck Little Claus's one horse on the head, so
that it fell down dead.</p>

<p>"Oh, now I haven't any horse at all!" cried
Little Claus, and he began to weep. But after
a while he flayed the horse and hung up the skin
to dry in the wind.</p>

<p>Then he put the dried skin into a bag, and
hanging it over his shoulder, went off to the next
town to sell it. He had a very long way to go
and was obliged to pass through a great, gloomy
wood. A dreadful storm came up. He lost his
way, and before he found it again, evening was
drawing on. It was too late to get to the town,
and too late to get home before nightfall.</p>

<p>Near the road stood a large farmhouse. The
shutters outside the windows were closed, but
lights shone through the crevices and at the top.
"They might let me stay here for the night,"
thought Little Claus. So he went up to the door
and knocked. The door was opened by the farmer's
wife, but when he explained what it was that
he wanted, she told him to go away; her husband,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
she said, was not at home, and she could not let
any strangers in.</p>

<p>"Then I shall have to lie out here," said Little
Claus to himself, as the farmer's wife shut the
door in his face.</p>

<p>Close to the farmhouse stood a tall haystack,
and between it and the house was a small shed
with a thatched roof. "I can lie up there," said
Little Claus, when he saw the roof. "It will make
a capital bed, but I hope the stork won't fly down
and bite my legs." A stork was just then standing
near his nest on the house roof.</p>

<p>So Little Claus climbed onto the roof of the
shed and proceeded to make himself comfortable.
As he turned round to settle himself, he discovered
that the wooden shutters did not reach to the tops
of the windows. He could look over them straight
into the room, in which a large table was laid
with wine, roast meat, and a fine, great fish. The
farmer's wife and the sexton were sitting at the
table all by themselves, and she was pouring out
wine for him, while his fork was in the fish, which
he seemed to like the best.</p>

<p>"If I could only get some too," thought Little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
Claus, and as he stretched his neck toward the
window he spied a large, beautiful cake. Goodness!
what a glorious feast they had before them.</p>

<p>At that moment some one came riding down
the road towards the farm. It was the farmer
himself, returning. He was a good man enough,
but he had one very singular prejudice&mdash;he could
not bear the sight of a sexton, and if he came on
one he fell into a terrible rage. This was the reason
that the sexton had gone to visit the farmer's
wife during his absence from home and that the
good wife had put before him the best she had.</p>

<p>When they heard the farmer they were frightened,
and the woman begged the sexton to creep
into a large empty chest which stood in a corner.
He did so with all haste, for he well knew how
the farmer felt toward a sexton. The woman hid
the wine and all the good things in the oven,
for if her husband were to see them, he would
certainly ask why they had been provided.</p>

<p>"O dear!" sighed Little Claus, on the shed
roof, as he saw the good things disappear.</p>

<p>"Is any one up there?" asked the farmer, looking
up where Little Claus was. "What are you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
doing up there? You had better come with me
into the house."</p>

<p>Then Little Claus told him how he had lost his
way, and asked if he might have shelter for the
night.</p>

<p>"Certainly," replied the farmer; "but the first
thing is to have something to eat."</p>

<p>The wife received them both in a friendly way,
and laid the table, bringing to it a large bowl
of porridge. The farmer was hungry and ate
with a good appetite. But Little Claus could
not help thinking of the capital roast meat,
fish, and cake, which he knew were hidden in
the oven.</p>

<p>He had put his sack with the hide in it under
the table by his feet, for, we must remember, he
was on his way to the town to sell it. He did not
relish the porridge, so he trod on the sack and
made the dried skin squeak quite loudly.</p>

<p>"Hush!" said Little Claus to his bag, at the
same time treading upon it again, to make it
squeak much louder than before.</p>

<p>"Hollo! what's that you've got in your bag?"
asked the farmer.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, it's a magician," said Little Claus, "and
he says we needn't eat the porridge, for he has
charmed the oven full of roast meat, fish, and cake."</p>

<p>"What?" cried the farmer, and he opened the
oven with all speed and saw all the nice things
the woman had hidden, but which he believed the
magician had conjured up for their special benefit.</p>

<p>The farmer's wife did not say a word, but set
the food before them; and they both made a hearty
meal of the fish, the meat, and the cake. Little
Claus now trod again upon his sack and made the
skin squeak.</p>

<p>"What does he say now?" inquired the farmer.</p>

<p>"He says," promptly answered Little Claus,
"that he has conjured up three bottles of wine,
which are standing in the corner near the stove."
So the woman was obliged to bring the wine
which she had hidden, and the farmer and Little
Claus became right merry. Would not the farmer
like to have such a conjurer as Little Claus carried
about in his sack?</p>

<p>"Can he conjure up the Evil One?" inquired
the farmer. "I shouldn't mind seeing him now,
when I'm in such a merry mood."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," said Little Claus, "he will do anything
that I please"; and he trod on the bag till it
squeaked. "You hear him answer, 'Yes, only the
Evil One is so ugly that you had better not see
him.'"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm not afraid. What will he look like?"</p>

<p>"Well, he will show himself to you in the
image of a sexton."</p>

<p>"Nay, that's bad indeed. You must know that
I can't abide a sexton. However, it doesn't matter,
for I know he's a demon, and I shan't mind
so much. Now my courage is up! Only he
mustn't come too close."</p>

<p>"I'll ask him about it," said Little Claus, putting
his ear down as he trod close to the bag.</p>

<p>"What does he say?"</p>

<p>"He says you can go along and open the
chest in the corner, and there you'll see him
cowering in the dark. But hold the lid tight,
so that he doesn't get out."</p>

<p>"Will you help me to hold the lid," asked the
farmer, going along to the chest in which his
wife had hidden the sexton, who was shivering
with fright.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span></p>

<p>The farmer opened the lid a wee little way
and peeped in. "Ha!" he cried, springing backward.
"I saw him, and he looks exactly like
our sexton. It was a shocking sight!"</p>

<p>They must needs drink after this, and there
they sat till far into the night.</p>

<p>"You must sell me your conjurer," said the
farmer. "Ask anything you like for him. Nay,
I'll give you a bushel of money for him."</p>

<p>"No, I can't do that," said Little Claus. "You
must remember how much benefit I can get from
such a conjurer."</p>

<p>"Oh, but I should so like to have him!" said
the farmer, and he went on begging for him.</p>

<p>"Well," said Little Claus at last, "since you
have been so kind as to give me a night's shelter,
I won't say nay. You must give me a bushel of
money, only I must have it full to the brim."</p>

<p>"You shall have it," said the farmer; "but
you must take that chest away with you. I won't
have it in the house an hour longer. You could
never know that he might not still be inside."</p>

<p>So Little Claus gave his sack with the dried
hide of the horse in it and received a full bushel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
of money in return, and the measure was full to
the brim. The farmer also gave him a large wheelbarrow,
with which to take away the chest and
the bushel of money.</p>

<p>"Good-by," said Little Claus, and off he went
with his money and the chest with the sexton
in it.</p>

<p>On the other side of the forest was a wide,
deep river, whose current was so strong that it
was almost impossible to swim against it. A large,
new bridge had just been built over it, and when
they came to the middle of the bridge Little
Claus said in a voice loud enough to be heard
by the sexton: "What shall I do with this stupid
old chest? It might be full of paving stones, it
is so heavy. I am tired of wheeling it. I'll just
throw it into the river. If it floats down to my
home, well and good; if not, I don't care. It will
be no great matter." And he took hold of the
chest and lifted it a little, as if he were going to
throw it into the river.</p>

<p>"No, no! let be!" shouted the sexton. "Let
me get out."</p>

<p>"Ho!" said Little Claus, pretending to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
frightened. "Why, he is still inside. Then I must
heave it into the river to drown him."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no, no!" shouted the sexton; "I'll give
you a whole bushelful of money if you'll let me out."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's another matter," said Little Claus,
opening the chest. He pushed the empty chest
into the river and then went home with the sexton
to get his bushelful of money. He had already
had one from the farmer, you know, so now his
wheelbarrow was quite full of money.</p>

<p>"I got a pretty fair price for that horse, I must
admit," said he to himself, when he got home and
turned the money out of the wheelbarrow into a
heap in the middle of the floor. "What a rage
Great Claus will be in when he discovers how rich
I am become through my one horse. But I won't
tell him just how it happened." So he sent a boy
to Great Claus to borrow a bushel measure.</p>

<p>"What can he want with it?" thought Great
Claus, and he rubbed some tallow on the bottom
so that some part of whatever was measured
might stick to it. And so it did, for when the
measure came back, three new silver threepenny
bits were sticking to it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span></p>

<p>"What's this!" said Great Claus, and he ran
off at once to Little Claus. "Where on earth did
you get all this money?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's for my horse's skin. I sold it
yesterday morning."</p>

<p>"That was well paid for, indeed," said Great
Claus. He ran home, took an ax, and hit all his
four horses on the head; then he flayed them
and carried their skins off to the town.</p>

<p>"Hides! hides! who'll buy my hides?" he
cried through the streets.</p>

<p>All the shoemakers and tanners in the town
came running up and asked him how much he
wanted for his hides.</p>

<p>"A bushel of money for each," said Great
Claus.</p>

<p>"Are you mad?" they all said. "Do you think
we have money by the bushel?"</p>

<p>"Skins! skins! who'll buy them?" he shouted
again, and the shoemakers took up their straps,
and the tanners their leather aprons, and began
to beat Great Claus.</p>

<p>"Hides! hides!" they called after him. "Yes,
we'll hide you and tan you. Out of the town<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
with him," they shouted. And Great Claus made
the best haste he could to get out of the town,
for he had never yet been thrashed as he was
being thrashed now.</p>

<p>"Little Claus shall pay for this," he said, when
he got home. "I'll kill him for it."</p>

<p>Little Claus's old grandmother had just died
in his house. She had often been harsh and
unkind to him, but now that she was dead he
felt quite grieved. He took the dead woman
and laid her in his warm bed to see if she
would not come to life again. He himself intended
to sit in a corner all night. He had slept
that way before.</p>

<p>As he sat there in the night, the door opened
and in came Great Claus with his ax. He knew
where Little Claus's bed stood, and he went
straight to it and hit the dead grandmother a
blow on the forehead, thinking it was Little
Claus.</p>

<p>"Just see if you'll make a fool of me again,"
said he, and then he went home.</p>

<p>"What a bad, wicked man he is!" said Little
Claus. "He was going to kill me. What a good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
thing that poor grandmother was dead already!
He would have taken her life."</p>

<p>He now dressed his grandmother in her best
Sunday clothes, borrowed a horse of his neighbor,
harnessed it to a cart, and set his grandmother
on the back seat, so that she could not fall when
the cart moved. Then he started off through the
woods. When the sun rose, he was just outside
a big inn, and he drew up his horse and went in
to get something to eat.</p>

<p>The landlord was a very rich man and a very
good man, but he was hot-tempered, as if he
were made of pepper and snuff. "Good morning!"
said he to Little Claus; "you have your
best clothes on very early this morning."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Little Claus, "I'm going to town
with my old grandmother. She's sitting out there
in the cart; I can't get her to come in. Won't
you take her out a glass of beer? You'll have
to shout at her, she's very hard of hearing."</p>

<p>"Yes, that I'll do," said the host, and he
poured a glass and went out with it to the dead
grandmother, who had been placed upright in
the cart.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span></p>

<p>"Here is a glass of beer your son has sent,"
said the landlord but she sat quite still and said
not a word.</p>

<p>"Don't you hear?" cried he as loud as he could.
"Here is a glass of beer from your son."</p>

<p>But the dead woman replied not a word, and at
last he became quite angry and threw the beer in
her face&mdash;and at that moment she fell backwards
out of the cart, for she was only set upright and
not bound fast.</p>

<p>"Now!" shouted Little Claus, as he rushed out
of the inn and seized the landlord by the neck,
"you have killed my grandmother! Just look at
the big hole in her forehead!"</p>

<p>"Oh! what a misfortune!" cried the man, "and
all because of my quick temper. Good Little
Claus, I will pay you a bushel of money, and I
will have your poor grandmother buried as if she
were my own, if only you will say nothing about
it. Otherwise I shall have my head cut off&mdash;and
that is so dreadful."</p>

<p>So Little Claus again received a whole bushel
of money, and the landlord buried the old grandmother
as if she had been his own.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span></p>

<p>When Little Claus got home again with all his
money, he immediately sent his boy to Great
Claus to ask to borrow his bushel measure.</p>

<p>"What!" said Great Claus, "is he not dead? I
must go and see about this myself." So he took
the measure over to Little Claus himself.</p>

<p>"I say, where did you get all that money?"
asked he, his eyes big and round with amazement
at what he saw.</p>

<p>"It was grandmother you killed instead of me,"
said Little Claus. "I have sold her and got a bushel
of money for her."</p>

<p>"That's being well paid, indeed," said Great
Claus, and he hurried home, took an ax and killed
his own old grandmother.</p>

<p>He then put her in a carriage and drove off to
the town where the apothecary lived, and asked
him if he would buy a dead person.</p>

<p>"Who is it and where did you get him?"
asked the apothecary.</p>

<p>"It is my grandmother, and I have killed her
so as to sell her for a bushel of money."</p>

<p>"Heaven preserve us!" cried the apothecary.
"You talk like a madman. Pray don't say such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
things, you may lose your head." And he told
him earnestly what a horribly wicked thing he
had done, and that he deserved punishment.
Great Claus was so frightened that he rushed out
of the shop, jumped into his cart, whipped up his
horse, and galloped home through the wood. The
apothecary and all the people who saw him thought
he was mad, and so they let him drive away.</p>

<p>"You shall be paid for this!" said Great Claus,
when he got out on the highroad. "You shall
be paid for this, Little Claus!"</p>

<p>Directly after he got home, Great Claus took
the biggest sack he could find and went over
to Little Claus.</p>

<p>"You have deceived me again," he said. "First
I killed my horses, and then my old grandmother.
That is all your fault; but you shall never have
the chance to trick me again." And he seized
Little Claus around the body and thrust him into
the sack; then he threw the sack over his back,
calling out to Little Claus, "Now I'm going to
the river to drown you."</p>

<p>It was a long way that he had to travel before
he came to the river, and Little Claus was not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
light to carry. The road came close to the church,
and the people within were singing beautifully.
Great Claus put down his sack, with Little
Claus in it, at the church door. He thought it
would be a very good thing to go in and hear
a psalm before he went further, for Little Claus
could not get out. So he went in.</p>

<p>"O dear! O dear!" moaned Little Claus in
the sack, and he turned and twisted, but found
it impossible to loosen the cord. Then there came
by an old drover with snow-white hair and a great
staff in his hand. He was driving a whole herd
of cows and oxen before him, and they jostled
against the sack in which Little Claus was confined,
so that it was upset.</p>

<p>"O dear," again sighed Little Claus, "I'm
so young to be going directly to the kingdom of
heaven!"</p>

<p>"And I, poor fellow," said the drover, "am so
old already, and cannot get there yet."</p>

<p>"Open the sack," cried Little Claus, "and creep
into it in my place, and you'll be there directly."</p>

<p>"With all my heart," said the drover, and he
untied the sack for Little Claus, who crept out at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
once. "You must look out for the cattle now,"
said the old man, as he crept in. Then Little
Claus tied it up and went his way, driving the
cows and the oxen.</p>

<p>In a little while Great Claus came out of the
church. He took the sack upon his shoulders
and thought as he did so that it had certainly
grown lighter since he had put it down, for the
old cattle-drover was not more than half as heavy
as Little Claus.</p>

<p>"How light he is to carry now! That must be
because I have heard a psalm in the church."</p>

<p>He went on to the river, which was both deep
and broad, threw the sack containing the old
drover into the water, and called after him, thinking
it was Little Claus, "Now lie there! You won't
trick me again!"</p>

<p>He turned to go home, but when he came to
the place where there was a crossroad he met
Little Claus driving his cattle.</p>

<p>"What's this?" cried he. "Haven't I drowned
you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Little Claus, "you threw me into
the river, half an hour ago."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span></p>

<p>"But where did you get all those fine cattle?"
asked Great Claus.</p>

<p>"These beasts are sea cattle," said Little Claus,
"and I thank you heartily for drowning me, for
now I'm at the top of the tree. I'm a very rich
man, I can tell you. But I was frightened when
you threw me into the water huddled up in the
sack. I sank to the bottom immediately, but I
did not hurt myself, for the grass is beautifully
soft down there. I fell upon it, and the sack was
opened, and the most beautiful maiden in snow-white
garments and a green wreath upon her hair
took me by the hand, and said to me, 'Have you
come, Little Claus? Here are cattle for you, and
a mile further up the road there is another herd!'</p>

<p>"Then I saw that she meant the river and that
it was the highway for the sea folk. Down at the
bottom of it they walk directly from the sea,
straight into the land where the river ends.
Lovely flowers and beautiful fresh grass were
there. The fishes which swam there glided about
me like birds in the air. How nice the people
were, and what fine herds of cattle there were,
pasturing on the mounds and about the ditches!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span></p>

<p>"But why did you come up so quickly then?"
asked Great Claus. "I shouldn't have done that
if it was so fine down there."</p>

<p>"Why, that was just my cunning. You know,
I told you that the mermaid said there was a
whole herd of cattle for me a mile further up the
stream. Well, you see, I know how the river bends
this way and that, and how long a distance it
would have been to go that way. If you can
come up on the land and take the short cuts,
driving across fields and down to the river again,
you save almost half a mile and get the cattle
much sooner."</p>

<p>"Oh, you are a fortunate man!" cried Great
Claus. "Do you think I could get some sea cattle
if I were to go down to the bottom of the river?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure you would," said Little Claus. "But
I cannot carry you. If you will walk to the river
and creep into a sack yourself, I will help you
into the water with a great deal of pleasure."</p>

<p>"Thanks!" said Great Claus. "But if I do not
find sea cattle there, I shall beat you soundly, you
may be sure."</p>

<p>"Oh! do not be so hard on me."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span></p>

<p>And so they went together to the river. When
the cows and oxen saw the water, they ran to it as
fast as they could. "See how they hurry!" cried
Little Claus. "They want to get back to the
bottom again."</p>

<p>"Yes, but help me first or I'll thrash you,"
said Great Claus. He then crept into a big sack,
which had been lying across the back of one of
the cows. "Put a big stone in or I'm afraid I
shan't sink."</p>

<p>"Oh, that'll be all right," said Little Claus, but
he put a big stone into the sack and gave it a
push. Plump! and there lay Great Claus in the
river. He sank at once to the bottom.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid he won't find the cattle," said
Little Claus. Then he drove homeward with
his herd.</p>

<h2>NOTES</h2>


<h3>THE STORKS</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><div class='hang1'><span class="smcap"><a href="#Page_29">Page 29</a>.</span> On account of the ravages it makes among noxious animals,
the stork is a privileged bird wherever it makes its home.
In cities it is sometimes trained to act as scavenger. In Denmark,
Holland, and Germany it is always a welcome guest. Boxes are
placed upon roofs in the hope that nests may be made in them,

especially for the care it is said to give to its parents in their old
age. It has no song, and is in no sense a bird to love, though it

a number of most important scientific discoveries. To him is attributed
the saying in regard to the earth, when under trial for
the supposed heresy of believing in its motion, "<i>It moves</i>,

<p><i>Dante</i> was the greatest of Italian poets.</p>

<p><i>Alfieri</i> and <i>Machiavelli</i> were authors.</p>

<p>Opposite the grave of Galileo is the tomb of <i>Michelangelo</i>, on
which stand his bust and three figures, representing sculpture,
painting, and architecture. Close by is a monument to Dante,
whose body is buried at Ravenna. On this monument Italy is
represented as pointing to the colossal statue of Dante, while
Poetry mourns his loss. A few steps farther on is Alfieri's monument,
which is adorned with laurel, the lyre, and dramatic masks;
Italy weeps over his grave. Machiavelli is the last in this group
of celebrated men.</p></div></div>
